connection with such sales, USCAA shall not, favor any payment product or method of payment over
any payment product or method of payment offered under the Program. Notwithstanding anything else
in this Agreement to the contrary, USCAA may accept print or on-line (including Wi-Fi transmitted)
advertising from any financial institution provided that the advertisement does not contain an express
or implied endorsement by USCAA of said financial institution or advertising for a Financial Service
Product.

(a)(2) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary: (W) USCAA may accept
advertising or sponsorships (e.g., sponsorship of events, naming rights of facilities) from any financial
institution provided that the advertisement or sponsorship does not contain an express endorsement by
USCAA of any Financial Service Product of any entity other than Bank (e.g., USCAA may grant to a third
party banking sponsor official designation rights, the ability to generally promote its banking services
(without reference to any Financial Service Product) and the right to use USCAA Trademarks in
connection with non-Financial Service Product sponsorship, marketing, promotional and hospitality
activities; provided, however, without limitation of the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, that
such banking sponsor may not use USCAA Trademarks on any credit devices, debit devices, checks or
Customer records and may not use USCAA Trademarks to promote or market a Financial Service
Product); (xX) any Financial Service Product as currently offered and provided as of the Effective Date
only by the USC Credit Union shall not be a violation of this Section 2(a), provided that the only USCAA
Trademarks used in connection with such Financial Service Product are the Trojan statute on USC Credit
Union?s card plastics, and the term ?Trojans? in USC Credit Union advertising for such Financial Service
Product; and (Y) the credit device that uses a closed, proprietary payment network and that is provided
by University for student, faculty and employee purchases only at University and designated local
venues, currently referred to as the USCard, shall be an exception to the exclusivity granted to Bank in
this Section 2(a).

(b) USCAA agrees to provide Bank with such information and assistance as may be reasonably
requested by Bank in connection with the Program.

(c) USCAA authorizes Bank to solicit Members by mail, direct promotion, internet, email,
advertisements, banking centers, ATMs, telephone or any other means for participation in the Program.

(d) USCAA shall have the right of prior approval of all Program materials, including the depiction of
an USCAA Trademark or University Trademark in all Program advertising and solicitation materials to be
used by Bank, including but not limited to credit card designs. If the Bank incurs a cost (e.g., the cost of
reissuing new credit cards) because of a change in the USCAA Trademarks or University Trademarks for
which USCAA does not provide Bank with at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice
and is unable to use up inventory of collateral and similar materials, Bank may deduct such actual costs
from any Royalties due USCAA. If such costs exceed Royalties then due USCAA, upon demand USCAA
shall promptly reimburse Bank for all such costs.

(e) At least once annually and within 30 days of Bank?s request, USCAA shall provide Bank with its
entire and complete updated Marketing List at no additional charge; provided, however, that USCAA
shall not include in any Marketing List the name and/or related information regarding any Member who
has expressly requested that USCAA not provide his/her personal information to third parties or who, to
the best knowledge of USCAA, is under the age of eighteen at the time the information was collected. In
the event that Bank incurs a cost because of a charge assessed by USCAA or its agents for an initial
Marketing List or an update to the Marketing List, Bank may deduct such costs from any payments
(including Royalties) then due USCAA. If such costs exceed such payments, upon demand USCAA shall
promptly reimburse Bank for all such costs. Within 30 days of the Effective Date, USCAA shall provide
the first Marketing List, containing the required information for at least two hundred thousand
