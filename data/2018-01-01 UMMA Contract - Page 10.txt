7, CONFIDENTIALITY

The terms of this Agreement, any proposal, financial information and proprietary
information provided by or on behalf of one party to the other party prior to,
contemporaneously with, or after the Effective Date of this Agreement ("Information")
are confidential as of the date of disclosure. Such Information will not be disclosed by
such other party to any other person or entity, except as permitted under this Agreement
or as mutually agreed in writing. Credit Union and Alumni Association will be permitted
to disclose such Information to their accountants, lawyers, financial advisors, marketing
advisors, affiliates and employees ("Agents") and, in the case of the Alumni Association,
to the University, as necessary for the performance of their respective duties, provided
that said persons agree to treat the Information as confidential in the above described
manner. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to prevent the disclosure of
Information received hereunder pursuant to any regulatory, self-regulatory or supervisory
authority having appropriate jurisdiction, and any applicable law, regulation or court
order, provided that (1) such disclosure will be limited to the minimum acceptable level
of disclosure; (2) unless prohibited by such regulatory, self-regulatory or supervisory
authority, or such law, regulation or court order, the affected party is notified of the
imminent disclosure as soon as is practicable so that such party may seek a protective
order or otherwise object; and (3) the disclosing party will exert reasonable best efforts to
minimize or prevent such disclosure to the maximum extent allowed under applicable
law, regulation or court order. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement,
the parties shall destroy all Information. Each party acknowledges that a breach by the
other party of that party?s obligations under this Section 7 will cause irreparable harm to
the non-breaching party for which money damages would not be adequate. In the event a
party files a petition for temporary or permanent injunctive relief alleging a violation of
this Section 7, the defendant agrees that the petitioner need not prove that its injury is
irreparable, or that it does not have an adequate remedy at law. In the event a court issues
a preliminary injunction against a party for violation of its duties under this Section 7, the
party against whom the injunction is issued waives any requirement that the petitioner
post a security bond. Any party who discloses Information to its Agents shall be liable
for any breach of this Section 7 by their Agents.
