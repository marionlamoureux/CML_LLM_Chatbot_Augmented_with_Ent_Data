Color specifications 4

Our preferred color version is the two-color
mark with PSU dark blue and PSU light blue.
This two-color mark is preferred and should be
used on most applications.

One-color applications may use PSU dark blue
with a screen as a cost-saving measure, or black
with a screen, which is intended primarily for
ads in newspapers or other inexpensive applica-
tions.

Logo artwork has been prepared for all color
combinations demonstrated here. We have
Pantone? artwork for match-color printing,
CMYK artwork for four-color process printing
and RGB artwork for web, PowerPoint, and
Word applications

The information on this page provides
specifications to manage our mark colors in
Pantone?, CMYK, and RGB color systems.
Colors look different in application, from match-
color to four-color process, from page to
screen, and even coated to uncoated paper
stocks. When trying to match our colors in other
media, such as a thread for stitching or
silk-screen, use the Pantone? coated color
swatch to match.
