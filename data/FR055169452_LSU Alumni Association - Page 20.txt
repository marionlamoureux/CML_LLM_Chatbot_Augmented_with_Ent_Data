All Eligible Royalties accrued shall, in lieu of direct payment to LSUAA, be applied against each of the Advances
until such time as all Advances are fully recouped. Any Eligible Royalties accrued thereafter shall be paid to
LSUAA as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Bank shall no longer be obligated to
pay any additional Advances to LSUAA hereunder, and (y) LSUAA hereby promises to pay Bank upon demand an
amount equal to the difference between the total amount of the Advance(s) paid by Bank and the total amount
of accrued Eligible Royalties credited by Bank against such Advance(s) as of the date of such demand, in the
event any of the conditions set forth in Clauses (i) through (v) below should occur:

{i) the Agreement is terminated prior to the end of the Initial Term as stated in this Agreement as of
the Effective Date;

(ii) LSUAA breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least six (6) direct mail campaigns to
the full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the term of
the Agreement;

(iv) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least one (1) e-mail campaign to the
full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the term of the
Agreement; and

(v) Bank shall not be prohibited from conducting promotion campaigns at major LSUAA events during
each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the term of the Agreement.

25 if during any given year(s) during the initial term of this Agreement Bank recoups all prior Advances paid
by it to LSUAA in prior years, and pays LSUAA Eligible Royalties accrued by LSUAA over and above the Eligible
Royalties used by Bank to recoup such prior Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?), then Bank may reduce the
amount of any subsequent Advance(s) due by the amount of any such Paid Out Royalties.

F, ROYALTY GUARANTEE

LSUAA shall be guaranteed to accrue Eligible Royalties (including without limitation the amount of the Advances)
equal to or greater than one million seventy-five thousand dollars ($1,075,000.00) (the ?Guarantee Amount?) by
June 30, 2023, subject to the provisions set forth below. If on June 30, 2023, LSUAA has not accrued one million
seventy-five thousand dollars ($1,075,000.00) in Eligible Royalties, Bank will pay LSUAA an amount equal to the
Guarantee Amount minus the sum of all compensation accrued by LSUAA during the initial term of this
Agreement and all unrecouped Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Royalty Guarantee and any
obligation of Bank hereunder shall be expressly contingent upon the non-occurrence of any of the conditions set
forth in Subsection E.1., above.
