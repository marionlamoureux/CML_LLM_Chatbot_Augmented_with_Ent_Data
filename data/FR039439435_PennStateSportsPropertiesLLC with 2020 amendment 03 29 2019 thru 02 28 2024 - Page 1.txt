Following the Initial Term, this agreement will automatically extend to include the 2024-2025 through 2028-2029 seasons
(?Extended Term?)*, and under the terms outlined in this agreement, unless University elects to terminate this agreement for
the 2024-2025 through 2028-2029 athletic years by providing written notice to Provider and Sponsor on or before February
28, 2024. The Initial Term and the Extended Term shall be referred to herein as the ?Term?. Subject to University?s Tight to
terminate this Agreement as provided above, if Provider is not the Multi-Media Rights Holder at any time during the Term,
this Agreement shall be automatically assigned to University or University?s incumbent multi-media rights holder.

Neither Party shall have any of the rights set forth in this Agreement after its expiration except for obligations which by their
nature shall survive termination.

2. Sponsorship Benefits. During the Term, provided that Sponsor fulfills all of its payment obligations to Provider, Sponsor will
teceive the benefits described on Exhibit A attached to this Agreement and made a part hereof (the ?Benefits?).

3. Make-Good Benefits. If, for any reason other than Sponsor's fault, Provider is unable to provide Sponsor with a Benefit

benefits not received by Sponsor in lieu of the Benefit(s) Provider is unable to provide to Sponsor (?Make-Good Benefits?).
The Make-Good Benefits will be subject to Sponsor?s approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Until such time as the Make-Good Benefits are agreed upon, Sponsor will continue to pay the full sponsorship fee to Provider

fee to be paid by Sponsor will be adjusted to reflect the Benefits which are not available to Sponsor. In the event that the
Parties cannot mutually agree upon Make-Good Benefits and the sponsorship fee is adjusted, such adjustment will be mutually
agreed upon in writing by both Provider and Sponsor.
