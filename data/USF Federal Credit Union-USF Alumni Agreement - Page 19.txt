Dear Mr. Koehler:

This letter serves as a follow up to our recent discussion and agreement on a one-year extension of
the University of South Florida Alumni Association Affinity Agreement dated August 1, 2012
between USF Federal Credit Union and University of South Florida Alumni Association.

By acceptance of this letter, USF Federal Credit Union will extend the terms of the original
Agreement, as well as the Addendums dated November 29, 2012 and August 5, 2013, for a period
of one-year, ending on July 31, 2018. Further, effective August 1, 2017, USF Federal Credit Union
will increase the monthly minimum royalty guarantee outlined in section 5 of the University of
South Florida Alumni Association Affinity Agreement and amended in the University of South
Florida Alumni Association Affinity Agreement Addendum dated November 29, 2012 by 10 percent.
The new monthly minimum guarantee that will apply from August 1, 2017 until July 31, 2018 is
$22,183.33.

Finally, to reiterate our discussion, it is the intent of both parties to enter into negotiations in late
2017 on a new five-year agreement that would be effective August 1, 2018, thus extending the
current success and strengthening the desired long term relationship between USF Federal Credit
Union and USF Alumni Association.

Please signify your acceptance of this extension by signing below and returning an executed copy to
my attention.

As always, thank you for the opportunity to partner with USF Federal Credit Union to bring your
unique and beneficial financial products to alumni and friends of the University of South Florida.

Teel ?ee a

William H. McCausland
Executive Director
