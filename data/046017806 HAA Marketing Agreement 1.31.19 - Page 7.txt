year each (each a ?Renewal Term?) unless, at least thirty (30) days prior to the termination of the
Initial Term or the then current Renewal Term, either Party shall have notified the other in writing
of its decision not to renew this Agreement (the Initial Term with any Renewal Term referred to
collectively as the ?Term?). If the terms hereof are to be amended in connection with any renewal,
an appropriate addendum executed by all of the Parties hereto shall be added to this Agreement
reflecting, as applicable, the revised terms hereof.

(b) If there is a material breach or default by either Party in the performance of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Licensing Agreement, and such default shall
continue for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by the defaulting Party of written notice
thereof from the non-defaulting Party (setting forth in detail the nature of such default), then this
Agreement shall terminate at the option of the non-defaulting Party as of the 31% day following
the receipt of such written notice. If, however, the default cannot be remedied within such thirty
(30) day period, such time period shall be extended for an additional period of not more than thirty
(30) days, so long as the defaulting Party has notified the non-defaulting Party in writing and in
detail of its plans to initiate substantive steps to remedy the default and diligently thereafter pursues
the same to completion within such additional thirty (30) day period.

(c) This Agreement shall be deemed immediately terminated, without the requirement
of further action or notice by either Party, in the event that (i) either Party, or a direct or indirect
holding company of either Party, shall become subject to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership, conservatorship or like proceedings (including, but not limited to, the
takeover of such Party by the applicable regulatory agency) pursuant to applicable state or federal
law or ceases to conduct its normal and customary business operations or (ii) either Party is found
in a court of competent jurisdiction, or executes a settlement with an appropriate governmental agency
in which the Party admits, to have violated or to be in violation of federal, state or local laws or
regulations relating to the services hereunder.

(d) In the event that any representation made by a Party set forth in Section 8 of this
Agreement shall prove to be untrue, then the other Party shall have the right to immediately
terminate this Agreement and all of its obligations contained herein by notice to the Party that
made the false representation.

(e) Upon termination of this Agreement:

(i) Upon HUECU?s reasonable request, HAA shall use reasonable efforts to
return to HUECU take-one and other marketing materials that have been supplied to HAA by
HUECU. HAA shall be permitted to maintain copies of such marketing materials for archival
purposes or required by applicable law;

(ii) All Accounts which have been opened pursuant to the terms hereof,
together with all Accounts for which applications have been received but not yet processed by
HUECU as of the effective date of such termination, shall remain the sole and exclusive property
of HUECU subject to HARVARD?s rights to purchase or designate a buyer to purchase the
Accounts as stipulated in the Licensing Agreement;
