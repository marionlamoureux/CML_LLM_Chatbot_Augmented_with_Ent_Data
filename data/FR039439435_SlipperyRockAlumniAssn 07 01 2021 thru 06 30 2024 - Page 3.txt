. NON-DISCRIMINATION. The Parties and any subcontractor(s) shall abide by the requirements of 41

CFR 88 60-1.4(a), 60-300.5(a) and 60-741.5(a). These regulations prohibit discrimination against
qualified individuals based on their status as protected veterans or individuals with disabilities, and
prohibit discrimination against all individuals based on their race, color, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identification, or national origin. Moreover, these regulations require that
covered prime contractors and subcontractors take affirmative action to employ and advance in
employment individuals without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identification, national origin, protected veteran status or disability.

FORCE MAJEURE. Neither party will incur any liability to the other if its performance of any
obligation under this Agreement is prevented or delayed by causes beyond its control and without
the fault or negligence of that party. Causes beyond a party's control include, but are not limited
to, acts of God, warfare, terrorism, changes in controlling law or regulations, orders of or the
requirements of any governmental entity, severe weather conditions, civil disorders, natural
disasters, fire, epidemics and quarantines, general strikes, and any public utility or Internet failure.

. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by any court of competent

jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to the maximum
extent to which it is valid and enforceable as determined by such court in such action, and the
remaining provisions of the Agreement will, nevertheless, continue in full force and effect without
being impaired or invalidated in any way.

. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in

accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (without regard to any conflict of
law provisions). Each Party consents to the jurisdiction of any court of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and any federal courts in Pennsylvania, waiving any claim or defense that such forum
is not convenient or proper.

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. In performing the services required by the Agreement, each Party
will act as an Independent Contractor. Neither Party shall act or have the authority to bind the
other to any third person nor otherwise to act in any manner as the agent or representative of the
other.
