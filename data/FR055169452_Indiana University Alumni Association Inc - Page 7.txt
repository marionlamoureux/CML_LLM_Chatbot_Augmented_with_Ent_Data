RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF IUAA

(a) IUAA agrees that during the Term it will endorse the Program exclusively and that neither IUAA
nor any IUAA Affiliate will, by itself or in conjunction with others, directly or indirectly: (i) endorse,
sponsor, advertise, aid, develop, market, solicit proposals for programs offering, or discuss with any
organization (other than Bank) the providing of, any Financial Service Products of any entity other than
Bank; (ii) license, allow others to license, or use or allow to exist the use by others of the IUAA Trademarks
or University Trademarks in relation to or for promoting any Financial Service Products (or the use of any
Financial Service Products) of any entity other than Bank; and (iii) sell, rent or otherwise make available
or allow others to sell, rent or otherwise make available any of its marketing lists, mailing lists, or
information about any current or potential Members in relation to or for promoting any Financial Service
Products of any entity other than Bank. In addition, if IUAA or any IUAA Affiliate sells any product or
service, in connection with such sales, IUAA shall not, and shall cause IUAA Affiliates not to, favor any
payment product or method of payment over any payment product or method of payment offered under
the Program. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, IUAA may accept print or
on-line (including Wi-Fi transmitted) advertising and/or sponsorships for a specific event from any
financial institution provided that the advertisement does not contain an express or implied endorsement
by IUAA of said financial institution or advertising for a Financial Service Product. This provision shall not
apply to (w) any products already endorsed or sponsored by Indiana University Foundation (?IUF?),
University, or any department thereof (as such programs are currently structured and delineated and
under agreements which may be continued or renewed) prior to the date of this Agreement or (x) to
student debit cards (without a credit device), (y) smart cards, or (z) department cards used for purchasing
and procurement. Further, Bank?s exclusivity provided in this Agreement over Financial Service Products
shall not prohibit IUAA, IUF, or University from offering Corporate Cards. IUAA agrees that for the financial
services program of Corporate Cards, IUAA will not permit issuing bank to use IUAA Trademarks, mailing
lists, or information about current or potential Members in offering issuing bank?s financial services
program or products.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to
the expiration of the Term, IUAA may solicit proposals for programs offering and/or discuss with any
organization other than Bank the providing of any Financial Service Products of any entity other than Bank;
provided, however, IUAA shall not, directly or indirectly, prior to the expiration of the Term: (i) enter into
such agreement(s) that are effective prior to the termination or expiration of this Agreement, (ii) endorse,
advertise, offer or market any Financial Service Products of any entity other than Bank, or (iii) license or
allow others to use or license the IUAA or University Trademarks for use in relation to or for promoting or
supporting any Financial Service Products of any entity other than Bank. For the avoidance of doubt, the
confidentiality obligations under this Agreement continue to apply, however, nothing herein shall be
construed as a limitation on IUAA?s ability to share its own confidential or proprietary information with
any other Person.

(b) IUAA agrees to provide Bank with such information and assistance as may be reasonably
requested by Bank in connection with the Program.

(c) IUAA authorizes Bank to solicit Members by mail, direct promotion, internet, email,
advertisements, banking centers, ATMs, telephone or any other means for participation in the Program.
