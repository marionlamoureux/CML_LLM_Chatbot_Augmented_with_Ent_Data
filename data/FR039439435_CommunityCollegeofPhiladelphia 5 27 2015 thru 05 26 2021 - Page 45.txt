PSECU response:

Members can use virtually any ATM anywhere for free through our surcharge rebate
program. All members are rebated up to $8 per month. Members with recurring Direct
Deposit (no minimum required) are rebated up to $20 per month. In 2014, PSECU
rebated $4,914,347 in surcharges to our members. PSECU?s no-foreign ATM fee policy
and liberal surcharge rebate program gives members the ultimate freedom and
convenience when it comes to using ATMs. In an average month, PSECU members use
over 15,800 ATMs in Pennsylvania, unrestrained by bank network rules or other policies.

Please refer to Attachment 7 for a list of the surcharge-free ATMs in the
Philadelphia metropolitan area that have most recently been used by our
membership.
