provide member support for current members.

PSECU will provide attractive and economical account offerings for Bloomsburg students, faculty and
staff while they are on campus and after they leave the University, while ensuring privacy of all

personal member information.

PSECU will provide a digital infrastructure (mobile and online) that will allow students, faculty and
staff to easily access the related banking services virtually anytime, anywhere.

Following our successful business model, we utilize ATMs to act as the teller for cash and check
transactions through immediate access to deposited funds. Please refer to page 32 for PSECU?s Funds
Availability Policy. PSECU is then able to operate our Financial Education Centers with greater
flexibility in terms of mandatory schedules and security requirements that govern traditional branch

operations.

With regard to ATMs, PSECU acknowledges the need for deposit-accepting ATMs on campus and is
willing to continue to operate three (3) ATMs at their current locations and current functionalities on
the Bloomsburg campus.

General requirements of the University would include:

* To continue to provide PSECU with interior wall and floor space for use by the Credit Union as

the Financial Education Center
* To provide HVAC and electricity to the Credit Union for the operation of the Center
* To provide A/C (alternating current) power to the three currently approved ATM locations

PSECU will provide financial education and co-curricular programs for the Bloomsburg campus
community. PSECU will also serve as a resource for financial learning opportunities, which is consistent
with our not-for-profit mission and a guiding principle of PSECU?s University Development program.
