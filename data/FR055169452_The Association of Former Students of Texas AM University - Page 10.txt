If either Bank or Association becomes insolvent in that its liabilities exceed its assets or it is
unable to meet or it has ceased paying its obligations as they generally become due, or it is
adjudicated insolvent, or takes advantage of or is subject to any insolvency proceeding, or makes
an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is subject to receivership, conservatorship or
liquidation then the other party may immediately terminate this Agreement.

Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank will, except as set forth in
Section 10(d) of this Agreement, cease to use the Association Trademarks or University
Trademarks for Program marketing purposes, provided that Bank may conclude all solicitations
required by law. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank will not
claim any right, title, or interest in or to the Association Trademarks, University Trademarks or
to the Marketing Lists.

Bank will have the right to prior review and approval of any notice in connection with, relating
or referring to the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement to be communicated by
Association or any Association Affiliate to the Members. Such approval will not be
unreasonably withheld. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement , Bank will
have up to ninety (90) calendar days from the termination or expiration date to: (i) suspend
marketing and remove marketing materials from Bank?s marketing channels; (ii) use Association
Trademarks or University Trademarks in connection with existing Deposit Accounts, Credit
Card Accounts and Business Credit Card Accounts and those opened during such ninety (90) day
period; and (iii) remove Association Trademarks or University Trademarks from Program
collateral and account materials, such as statements, welcome packages, and card carriers.
Association shall not attempt to cause the removal of Association Trademarks or University
Trademarks from any person?s credit devices, debit devices, checks or records of any Customer
existing as of ninety (90) days following the termination or expiration date of this Agreement,
and Bank shal! have the right to use Association Trademarks and University Trademarks on such
credit devices, debit devices, checks and records until their normally scheduled reissue date or
exhaustion.

In the event that Applicable Law has or will have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses
(including the businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this
Agreement), as determined in Bank?s sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify Association in
writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If,
within thirty (30) business days after Association?s receipt of Bank?s notice, the parties have not,
for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory to both parties, Bank shall
have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card Program, or the
Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to Association, upon ninety (90) days
advance written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or
Credit Card Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Section
10(e), such terminated program remains subject to the provisions described in the sections
referenced in Section 12(b) of the Agreement and any other section in the Agreement that by its
terms are meant to survive the termination of this Agreement, and the rights and obligations in
any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program
shall be null and void, in each case, as if the termination of such program was a termination or
expiration of the Agreement for just that program.

For a one (1) year period immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement for any reason, Association agrees that neither Association, nor any Association
