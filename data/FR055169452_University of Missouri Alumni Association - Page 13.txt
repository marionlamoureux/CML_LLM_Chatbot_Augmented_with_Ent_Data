(b) This Agreement: (i) is a final, complete, and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of
the Parties with respect of the subject matter hereof and thereof; (ii) collectively constitute the entire
agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof; and (iii) supersede,
merge, and integrate herein any prior and contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, representations,
understandings, and agreements between any of the Parties (including the Original Agreement, the
Term Sheet and the Confidentiality Agreement). This Agreement does not and is not intended to alter
or amend any aspect or provision of any other agreement between the Parties that survives the
expiration or earlier termination of that agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no waiver by any Party shall operate or be construed
as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written waiver,
whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No failure
to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement
shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The provisions of this Subsection 12(c) shall survive the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(d) Titles, captions, and headings included herein are for convenience of reference only and are not to
affect the meaning, construction, or interpretation hereof or of any provision hereof.

(e) It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement
is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of
competent jurisdiction or Governmental Authority to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any
reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or affecting the
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in
such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the
remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.
