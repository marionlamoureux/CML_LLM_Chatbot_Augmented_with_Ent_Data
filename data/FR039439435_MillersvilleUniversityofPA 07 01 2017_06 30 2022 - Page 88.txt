Value of the PSECU On-Campus Intern Program

PSECU estimates the value of the PSECU on-campus intern program to be over $627,000 in salary,
benefits and incentives over the 5-year term of the contract.

We Go Beyond the Contract

PSECU believes in supporting worthwhile student initiatives and seeks relevant opportunities to sponsor
groups and events. We consider and evaluate all opportunities to participate in both academic and co-
curricular activities. While these are considered non-contractual obligations, they are equally
important to the student body. They help us work in conjunction with the campus community to raise
awareness for a student cause, support a student endeavor or promote engagement in a fun activity.

A few examples of recent sponsorships are:

e  Veteran?s Dinner Sponsorship
Athletic ?flare,? banner and scoreboard advertising at athletic events
Orientation breakfast for new student families
Discounted Cap and Gown Promotion for graduating PSECU members
Scholarship Dinner
?Stress-Free Zone? and ?Pet-a-Pooch? during finals week

PSECU?s longstanding support of Millersville University and its students goes well beyond contractual
obligations and commitments in the current student banking relationship with the University. We
remain a strong supporter of higher education efforts and place great emphasis on the education of
students, particularly in the area of financial literacy. Our successful track record at the 20-plus
institutions we serve speaks for itself, and we greatly value and look forward to a continued long-term
relationship with Millersville University.
