Re: University of Houston Trademarks
Dear Jitk:

Tam writing to clarify and confirm the scope of the permitted uses of University Trademarks as that term is
defined in the January 1, 2014 Amended and Restated Affinity Agreement (the ?Agreement?) between FIA Card

The authorization for the use of University Trademarks* set forth in the Agreement is limited to the use of such
trademarks only to promote the Program* for UHAA-endorsed affinity credit and debit cards. FIA acknowledges that the
