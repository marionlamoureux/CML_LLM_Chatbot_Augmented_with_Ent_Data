Public Records Act.

(c) <A Receiving Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) limit
access to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to those employees, authorized
agents, vendors, consultants, service providers and contractors who have a reasonable need
to access such Confidential Information in connection with the Credit Cards, the Program or
other purposes permitted by this Agreement, and (ii) obtain contractual confidentiality
commitments substantially similar to those set forth in this Section 6.2 from each vendor,
consultant, service provider or contractor to which the Receiving Party provides access to
the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, a Party will not
be obligated to take any action with respect to the collection, use or disclosure of
information with respect to the Credit Cards or the Program that such Party believes in
good faith would cause, or is reasonably likely to cause, either Party to violate any
Applicable Law (including privacy and security laws and the reuse and re-disclosure
provisions of the GLBA).

Governmental Requests/Applicable Law Requirements.

(a) If a Receiving Party receives a Governmental Request to disclose any
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, excluding requests received by Deserve
from any regulatory agency with jurisdiction over Deserve or any of its activities, or the
Receiving Party otherwise concludes based on advice of counsel that disclosure is otherwise
required by Applicable Law, then the Receiving Party shall, to the extent allowed or not
prohibited by Applicable Law: (i) notify the Disclosing Party thereof promptly after receipt
of such request; (ii) consult with the Disclosing Party on the advisability of the Disclosing
Party taking steps to resist or vary such request at its own expense; and (iii) if disclosure is
required or deemed advisable, cooperate with the Disclosing Party in any attempt by the
Disclosing Party at its own expense to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party.

(b) Each Party agrees, prior to disclosing Confidential Information of the other
Party with any Governmental Authority, to consult with the other Party with respect to
redacting, to the maximum extent practical and consistent with Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 6.3 shall not apply to
disclosures made by Deserve to any regulatory agency, except in the event that a regulatory
agency notifies Deserve that such agency is initiating a material inquiry specifically
regarding the Credit Cards or the Program itself, and disclosure to NJIT of such
notification and related communications by Deserve to such agency is not prohibited by
Applicable Law.

Disposition of Confidential information. The Receiving Party shall comply with the
Disclosing Party's reasonable instructions regarding the disposition of the Disclosing Party's
Confidential Information after the effective date of termination of this Agreement. Such
