How many POS vendors, i.e. restaurants, book store, are on each campus?
Three

The RFP states that bidders should consider performing modifications during the hours of 11 pm to 7
am. Is this a requirement or recommendation?
Recommended.

As an organization we perform due diligence for all vendors as required by NCUA, our federal regulator.
We are looking on guidance on how contractors of the College typically assure compliance with the
provisions outlined in the Affidavit regarding the MacBride Principles and Slavery Era Businesses.
Please give practical and concrete examples.

Bidders are attesting to what is described in the Affidavit by signing and notarizing the document.

The College can terminate any agreement with 30 days written notice. Will that be a mutual covenant?
Yes; however, the College would negotiate a longer term for ATM?s.

Will the winning bidder have exclusivity to market financial services on the campus?
Yes, except for student sponsored events.

Please provide ATM transaction numbers by machine on each campus.
July 1, 2014 through January 15, 2015: Bonnell Bldg.? 16,426 and Winnet Bldg.? 15,904.

Will there be availability to put a sign on the outside of the space near the ceiling facing out to the shared
space? See picture below.
Any signage must be reviewed and approved by the College?s Facilities Management Office.
