all other rate changes since the Effective Date, has more than a de minimis
adverse impact on Credit Union's businesses (including the businesses of any
Credit Union Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as
determined by Credit Union in its sole discretion ("Impact"), then Credit Union
may notify Alumni Association in writing of Credit Union's desire to renegotiate
the Royalties and any other financial terms in the Agreement to address the
Impact. If, within thirty (30) business days after Alumni Association's receipt of
Credit Union's notice, the parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an
addendum that modifies the Royalties and other financial terms to address the
Impact, Credit Union shall have the right to terminate either the Credit Card
Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to Alumni
Association, upon ninety (90) days advance written notice. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Credit Card Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as
provided for in this Section 5(b), such terminated program remains subject to the
provisions described in the sections referenced in Section 11(d) of the Agreement
and any other section in the Agreement that by its terms are meant to survive the
termination of this Agreement, and the rights and obligations in any other
provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such
program shall be null and void, in each case, as if the termination of such program
was a termination or expiration of the Agreement for just that program.

6. CONFIDENTIALITY

The terms of this Agreement, any proposal, financial information and proprietary
information provided by or on behalf of one party to the other party prior to,
contemporaneously with, or after the Effective Date of this Agreement ("Information")
are confidential as of the date of disclosure. Such Information will not be disclosed by
such other party to any other person or entity, except as permitted under this Agreement
or as mutually agreed in writing. Credit Union and Alumni Association will be permitted
to disclose such Information to their accountants, lawyers, financial advisors, marketing
advisors, affiliates and employees ("Agents") and, in the case of the Alumni Association,
to the University, as necessary for the performance of their respective duties, provided
that said persons agree to treat the Information as confidential in the above-described
manner. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to prevent the disclosure of
Information received hereunder pursuant to any regulatory, self-regulatory or supervisory
authority having appropriate jurisdiction, and any applicable law, regulation or court
order, provided that (1) such disclosure will be limited to the minimum acceptable level
of disclosure; (2) unless prohibited by such regulatory, self-regulatory or supervisory
authority, or such law, regulation or court order, the affected party is notified of the
imminent disclosure as soon as is practicable so that such party may seek a protective
order or otherwise object; and (3) the disclosing party will exert reasonable best efforts to
minimize or prevent such disclosure to the maximum extent allowed under applicable
Jaw, regulation or court order. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement,
the parties shall destroy all Information. Each party acknowledges that a breach by the
other party of that party?s obligations under this Section 7 will cause irreparable harm to
the non-breaching party for which money damages would not be adequate. In the event a
party files a petition for temporary or permanent injunctive relief alleging a violation of
