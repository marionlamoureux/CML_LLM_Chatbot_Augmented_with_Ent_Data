Instant Cards - PSECU?s instant card service provides the ability to create a temporary ATM
card at our Bloomsburg financial center for students, faculty, and staff. This service is
especially useful for new members awaiting their VISA? ATM/Debit Card who need immediate

the Bloomsburg University campus who have lost their VISA? ATM/Debit Card or have had their

card stolen.

mobile banking channels as a primary channel for account access. Recognized as a technology

leader in the credit union industry, PSECU continually strives to improve and enhance our
