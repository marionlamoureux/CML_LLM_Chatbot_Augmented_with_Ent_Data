ROYALTY ADVANCE

Within 45 days of full execution of this Agreement by Bank, and within 45 days of each annual
anniversary of the Effective Date in 2019 through 2022, respectively, during the Term of this Agreement,
Bank shall pay to Alumni Association as follows: four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000.00) in 2018,
three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) in 2019, two hundred seventy-five thousand dollars
($275,000.00) in 2020, two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) in 2021 and two hundred
twenty-five thousand dollars ($225,000.00) in 2022 (each and in the aggregate, an ?Advance?), as an
advance against future Eligible Royalties, subject to the provisions set forth below. All Eligible Royalties
accrued shall, in lieu of direct payment to Alumni Association, be applied against each of the Advances
until such time as all Advances are fully recouped. Any Eligible Royalties accrued thereafter shall be paid
to Alumni Association as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Bank shall no
longer be obligated to pay any additional Advances to Alumni Association hereunder, and (y) Alumni
Association hereby promises to pay Bank upon 30 days prior written notice an amount equal to the
difference between the total amount of the Advance(s) paid by Bank and the total amount of accrued
Eligible Royalties credited by Bank against such Advance(s) as of the date of such demand, in the event
any of the conditions set forth in Clauses (i) through (v) below should occur:

(i) the Agreement is terminated prior to the end of the Term as stated in this Agreement as of the
Effective Date;

|
(ii) Alumni Association materially breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement, provided that |
upon such a breach Bank shall give notice to all other Parties, which shall: (a) include a description of |
the material breach, (b) state Bank?s intention to no longer be obligated to pay any additional Advances
to Alumni Association, (c) state Bank?s intention to require Alumni Association to pay Bank upon 30 |
days prior written notice an amount equal to the difference between the total amount of the ,
Advance(s) paid by Bank and the total amount of accrued Eligible Royalties credited by Bank against |
such Advance(s) as of the date of such demand, pursuant to this Schedule A, Section F(1). If the Alumni |
Association does not cure or substantially cure such breach within 60 days after receipt of notice, as
provided herein (the ?Cure Period?), then Bank may enforce this Schedule A, Section F(1) upon
expiration of the Cure Period;

(iii) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least six (6) direct mail campaigns to
the full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term;

(iv) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least three (3) e-mail campaigns to
the full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term; and

(v) Bank is prohibited from conducting promotion campaigns at major Alumni Association events during
each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term.

If during any given year(s) during the Term of this Agreement Bank recoups all prior Advances paid by it
to Alumni Association in prior years, and pays Alumni Association Eligible Royalties accrued by Alumni
Association over and above the Eligible Royalties used by Bank to recoup such prior Advances (the ?Paid
Out Royalties?), then Bank may reduce the amount of any subsequent Advance(s) due by the amount of
any such Paid Out Royalties.
