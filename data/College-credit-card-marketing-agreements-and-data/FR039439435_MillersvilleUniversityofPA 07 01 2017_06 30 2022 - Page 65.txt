Since the University Development Program?s implementation in 2000, our experience with higher
education partners is evident in that we have successfully negotiated and renegotiated all contracts
that remain in force today. We welcome the opportunity to continue to extend our services to
Millersville University.

Please refer to Attachment 3 for PSECU?s most recent financial statements demonstrating our financial
stability.

PASSHE Standard Blueback Contract (Appendix B)

We have provided PSECU?s Standard Contract Terms in Attachment 4. PSECU proposes that these terms
are to be incorporated into the Standard Blueback Contract from PASSHE.

PSECU is amenable to any language that existed in prior Blueback contracts between PSECU and the University.

PSECU noted that the Blueback section numbers and titles listed in Section 1-13 of the RFP do not correspond
to the section numbers and titles in the version of the Blueback provided by the University to PSECU.

Because of the foregoing discrepancy, PSECU reserves its right to offer alternative contract language related
to the entire Blueback for consideration by the University during the contract negotiation process.
