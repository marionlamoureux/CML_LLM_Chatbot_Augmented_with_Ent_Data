ATTACHMENT ?A?
UNIVERSITY VISA REWARDS CARD

Qualified Members of University will be issued a University Visa Rewards Card with one or more
University Licensed Trademarks included on the face of the cards, as approved by Visa, U.S.A., as
appropriate.

Subject to the terms of the Cardholder Agreement, Commerce shall make available a card with an
interest rate to be determined at time of credit underwriting based on statistically valid determinants
of credit risk derived during the credit underwriting process. The precise terms and conditions of the
Cardholder Agreement will be consistent with rates and terms offered on other Commerce co-branded
and affinity credit card products.

All credit decisions, including but not limited to the initial approval of accounts, the establishment of
credit lines and the closing of accounts, shall be within the exclusive discretion of Commerce.

As the grantor of credit, Commerce assumes all credit risks and reserves the right to modify pricing
set forth in paragraph 2, above, consistent with its underwriting criteria, prevailing economic and
market forces, and the laws and regulations which apply.

The Cardholder Agreement, which governs the terms of credit extension and which is provided to
Accountholders at the time of issuance of an University Visa Rewards Card will reflect the terms
provided herein; except nothing contained herein shall preclude Commerce from including in such
Cardholder Agreement its standard contractual terms including, without limitation, those terms
relating to liability, default, cancellation, governing law, calculation of finance charge, payment
application, surrender and other terms as appropriate.
