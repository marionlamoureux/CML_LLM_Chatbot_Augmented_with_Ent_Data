Agreement, Bank shall have until the later of (i) 120 days from the termination or expiration date or (ii)
as soon as operationally reasonable by the Bank to: (x) suspend marketing and remove marketing
materials from Bank?s Marketing Channels; (y) use WFU Trademarks in connection with existing, Credit
Card Accounts and those opened during such period; and, (z) remove WFU Trademarks from Program
collateral and account materials in Bank?s possession, such as statements, welcome packages, and card
carriers. WFU shall not attempt to cause the removal of WFU Trademarks from any Person?s credit
devices, debit devices, checks or records of any Customer existing as of the day immediately following
the expiration or earlier termination of the Term. Bank shall have the right to use WFU Trademarks on
such credit devices, debit devices, checks and records until their normally scheduled reissue date or
exhaustion and issue credit cards bearing WFU Trademarks until such date. The provisions of this
Subsection 11(d) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(e) If Applicable Law has or could have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses (including the
businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined in
Bank?s sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify WFU in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the
terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If, within 30 business days after WFU?s receipt of Bank?s
notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory to
both Parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card
Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to WFU, upon 90 days advance
written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card
Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 11(e), such
terminated program remains subject to the Sections in the Agreement that by its express terms are
meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program shall
be null and void, in each case as if the termination of such program was a termination or expiration of
the Agreement for just that program.

(f) For the 1 year period immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement for any reason, WFU agrees that neither WFU nor any WFU Affiliate shall, by itself or in
conjunction with others, directly or indirectly, target any offer of a Financial Service Product for
purposes substantially similar to the Program to persons who were Customers. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, WFU may, after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, offer persons who
were Customers the opportunity to participate in another financial service program endorsed by WFU,
provided the opportunity is not only made available to such persons but rather as a part of a general
solicitation to all Members and provided further that persons are not directly or indirectly identified as a
customer of Bank, or offered any terms or incentives that differ from those offered to all Members. The
provisions of this Subsection 11(f) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(g) If ordered or requested to do so by any Governmental Authority, Bank may terminate this
Agreement without further obligation or penalty upon reasonable prior notice to WFU effective as of
the date specified in such notice or as required by such Governmental Authority.

(h) On or before the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, WFU agrees that it shall
(and shall direct its Subcontractors and their respective Representatives to): (i) immediately destroy and
purge from all its systems all Information, including Nonpublic Personal Information; and (ii) destroy
within 30 days all such Information that is in tangible form, including any and all full or partial copies, or
reproductions thereof in any medium whatsoever. WFU shall (and shall direct its Subcontractors and
their respective Representatives to) destroy all Information in accordance with Bank's then-current
