Apple FCU: Is not interested in co-brand checking, personal loans or deposit accounts with
the GMU Alumni. We would like to keep the original RFP offer of an affinity Visa credit card
only, with the same $50 per card terms originally offered in our response to the RFP. We
are willing to increase the minimum annual guarantee from $10,000 to $15,000 per year.

Mason: Agrees and accepts the minimum payment of $15,000 annually.
