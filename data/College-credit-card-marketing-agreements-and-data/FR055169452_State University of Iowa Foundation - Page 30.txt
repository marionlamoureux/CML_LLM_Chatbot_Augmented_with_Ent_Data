(i) the Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the end of the Initial Term as
stated in this Agreement as of the Effective Date;

(ii) UICA materially breaches any of its obligation under this Agreement and fails to cure such
breach, after notice thereof from Bank, within the applicable Cure Period;

(iii) Bank is prohibited by Applicable Law or otherwise prevented, through no fault of the Bank,
from conducting at least six (6) direct mail campaigns to the full updated Member List during each
consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Initial Term;

(iv) Bank is prohibited by Applicable Law or otherwise prevented, through no fault of Bank, from
conducting at least two (2) e-mail campaigns to the full updated Member List during each
consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Initial Term; and

(v) Bank shall not be prohibited from conducting promotion campaigns at major UICA alumni
events (excluding development and fundraising events) during each consecutive twelve (12)
month period during the Term.

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event there is no termination of the Agreement resulting from the
occurrence of any of the foregoing items (i) through (v), then subject to repayment of all unearned
Advances by UICA to Bank as provided above, UICA shall continue to accrue and receive Royalties in
accordance with this Agreement, provided that Bank will not pay any further Advance under this
Agreement, and will have no further obligation under Subsection F of this Schedule A-1.

2. If during any given year(s) during the Initial Term of this Agreement Bank recoups all prior Advances paid
by it under this Agreement to UICA in prior years, and pays UICA Eligible Royalties accrued by UICA over
and above the Eligible Royalties used by Bank to recoup such prior Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?),
then Bank may reduce the amount of any subsequent Advance(s) due by the amount of any such Paid
Out Royalties.

F. ROYALTY GUARANTEE

UICA shall be guaranteed to accrue Eligible Royalties (including the amount of the Advances under this
Agreement) equal to or greater than one million one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,150,000.00) (the
?Guarantee Amount?) by December 31, 2023, subject to the provisions set forth below. If on December
31, 2023 UICA has not accrued $1,150,000.00 in Eligible Royalties, Bank will pay UICA an amount equal
to the Guarantee Amount minus the sum of all Royalties accrued by UICA during the Initial Term and all
unrecouped Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Royalty Guarantee and any obligation of
Bank hereunder shall be expressly contingent upon the non-occurrence of any of the conditions set
forth in Subsection E(1)(i) through (v) above.
