Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank will, except as set forth in
Section 10(d) of this Agreement, cease to use the UNCCAA Trademarks or University
Trademarks for Program marketing purposes, provided that Bank may conclude all solicitations
required by law. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank will not
claim any right, title, or interest in or to the UNCCAA Trademarks, University Trademarks or to

the Marketing Lists.

Bank will have the right to prior review and approval of any notice in connection with, relating
or referring to the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement to be communicated by
Foundation, UNCCAA or any Foundation Affiliate or UNCCAA Affiliate to the Members. Such
approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement , Bank will have up to ninety (90) calendar days from the termination or expiration
date to: (i) suspend marketing and remove marketing materials from Bank?s marketing channels;
(ii) use UNCCAA Trademarks or University Trademarks in connection with existing Deposit
Accounts and Credit Card Accounts and those opened during such ninety (90) day period; and
(iii) remove UNCCAA Trademarks or University Trademarks from Program collateral and
account materials, such as statements, welcome packages, and card carriers. Foundation and
UNCCAA shall not attempt to cause the removal of UNCCAA Trademarks or University
Trademarks from any person?s credit devices, debit devices, checks or records of any Customer
existing as of ninety (90) days following the termination or expiration date of this Agreement,
and Bank shall have the right to use UNCCAA Trademarks and University Trademarks on such
credit devices, debit devices, checks and records until their normally scheduled reissue date or
exhaustion.

In the event that Applicable Law has or will have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses
(including the businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this
Agreement), as determined in Bank?s sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify Foundation and
UNCCAA in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the terms of the Agreement to address the
Event. If, within thirty (30) business days after Foundation?s and UNCCAA?s receipt of Bank?s
notice, the parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory
to both parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit
Card Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to Foundation and
UNCCAA, upon ninety (90) days advance written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card Program is terminated earlier than the
Agreement as provided for in this Section 10(e), such terminated program remains subject to the
provisions described in the sections referenced in Section 12(b) of the Agreement and any other
section in the Agreement that by its terms are meant to survive the termination of this
Agreement, and the rights and obligations in any other provision of this Agreement with respect
to the products offered under such program shall be null and void, in each case, as if the
termination of such program was a termination or expiration of the Agreement for just that
program.

For a one (1) year period immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement for any reason, Foundation and UNCCAA agree that neither Foundation, UNCCAA,
University, nor any Foundation Affiliate or UNCCAA Affiliate will, by itself or in conjunction
with others, directly or indirectly, target any offer of a Financial Service Product or a related
product to persons who were Customers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Foundation and
UNCCAA may, after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, offer persons who
were Customers the opportunity to participate in another financial service program endorsed by
