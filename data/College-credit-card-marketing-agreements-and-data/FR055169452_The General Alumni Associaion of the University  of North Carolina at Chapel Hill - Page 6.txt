ROYALTIES

(a) During the Term and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Bank shall pay Royalties as
described in Schedule A to GAA.

(b) No compensation or payments shall be paid to GAA until a Schedule B (W-9 Form and ACH Form) or
other IRS required form (e.g., W-8) is fully completed and returned to Bank. Except as otherwise
provided in Schedule A, payment of Royalties then due shall be made, in arrears, approximately 45 days
after the end of each calendar quarter.

(c) Ifat any time during the Term any change in any card network?s interchange rate(s) or similar rate(s),
when measured separately or together with all other rate changes since the Effective Date, has more
thana de minimis adverse impact on Bank?s businesses (including the businesses of any Bank Affiliate
providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined by Bank in its sole discretion
(?Impact?), then Bank may notify GAA in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the Royalties and any
other financial terms in the Agreement to address the Impact. If, within 30 business days after GAA?s
receipt of Bank?s notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that
modifies the Royalties and other financial terms to address the Impact, Bank shall have the right to
terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card Program, or the Agreement in its entirety,
without penalty or liability to GAA, upon 90 days advance written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in
the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement
as provided for in this Subsection, such terminated program remains subject to the applicable survival
provisions, if any and any other Section that by its terms are meant to survive the expiration or earlier
termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations in any other provision of this Agreement
with respect to the products offered under such program shall be null and void, in each case as if the
termination of such program was a termination or expiration of the Agreement for just that program.

(d) Notwithstanding anything In this Agreement to the contrary, Bank will not be required to pay Royalties
or any other compensation to GAA with regard to any student Credit Card Accounts. Bank may use the
GAA Trademarks on all Financial Service Products offered during the Term.
