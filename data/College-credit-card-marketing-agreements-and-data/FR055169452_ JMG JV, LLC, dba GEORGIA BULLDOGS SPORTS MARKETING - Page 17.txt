(c) Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall, except as set forth in
Subsection 11(d), cease to use the UGAA Trademarks and University Trademarks for Program marketing
purposes, provided that Bank may conclude all solicitations required by Applicable Law. Upon the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall not claim any right, title, or interest in or
to the UGAA Trademarks, University Trademarks or to the Marketing Lists. The provisions of this
Subsection 11(c) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(d) Bank shall have the right to prior review and approval of any notice in connection with, relating
or referring to the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement to be communicated by or on
behalf of JMG or any JMG Affiliate to the Members. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement, Bank shall have 120 days from the termination or expiration date to: (x) suspend marketing
and remove marketing materials from Bank?s marketing channels; (y) use UGAA Trademarks and
University Trademarks in connection with existing Debit Cards, Deposit Accounts, Credit Card Accounts
and those opened during such period; and, (z) remove UGAA Trademarks and University Trademarks
from Program collateral and account materials in Bank?s possession, such as statements, welcome
packages, and card carriers. JMG shall not attempt to cause the removal of UGAA Trademarks and
University Trademarks from any Person?s credit devices, debit devices, checks or records of any
Customer existing as of the day 90 days immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of
the Term. Bank shall have the right to use UGAA Trademarks and University Trademarks on such credit
devices, debit devices, checks and records issued pursuant to this Agreement until their normally
scheduled reissue date or exhaustion and issue credit cards and Debit Cards bearing UGAA Trademarks
and/or University Trademarks until such date. The provisions of this Subsection 11(d) shall survive the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(e) If Applicable Law has or could have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses (including the
businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined in
Bank?s sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify JMG in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the
terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If, within 30 business days after JMG?s receipt of Bank?s
notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory to
both Parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card
Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to JMG, upon 90 days advance
written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card
Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 11(e), such
terminated program remains subject to the Sections in the Agreement that by its express terms are
meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program shall
be null and void, in each case as if the termination of such program was a termination or expiration of
the Agreement for just that program.

(f) For the 1 year period immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement for any reason, JMG shall not, by itself or in conjunction with others, directly or indirectly,
target any offer of a Credit Card Product or a related product to persons who were Customers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, JMG may, after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement,
offer persons who were Customers the Opportunity to participate in another financial service program,
provided the opportunity is not only made available to such persons but rather as a part of a general
solicitation to all Members and provided further that persons are not directly or indirectly identified as a
customer of Bank. The provisions of this Subsection 11(f) shall survive the expiration or earlier
termination of this Agreement.

(g) If ordered or requested to do so by any Governmental Authority, either Party may terminate
this Agreement without further obligation or penalty upon notice to the other Party, with such
