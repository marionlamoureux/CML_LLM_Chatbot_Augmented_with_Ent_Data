violations of any Commerce program or any actual or suspected abuse or fraud with respect
to the credit card account.

3. As a one time ?Advance? against the combination of Royalties and New Account Fees
anticipated to be earned by Foundation during the Initial Term and any Renewal Term of this
Agreement, Commerce will pay Foundation an Advance of five thousand dollars (US $5,000)
within thirty (30) days of the Launch Date. The ?Launch Date? is the date on which the first
Foundation Rewards Card becomes Active. In the event that Foundation fails to earn sufficient
Royalties and New Account Fees during the Initial Term or any Renewal Term of this Agreement
to fully repay the Advance, Foundation will not be obligated to repay any unearned portion of
such Advance, provided, however, in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Commerce
as a result of a material breach of Foundation obligations under this Agreement, Foundation shall
pay to Commerce a pro rata refund of the unearned portion of such Advance (the ?Advance
Refund?). Foundation shall pay such Advance Refund to Commerce within thirty (30) days after
the effective date of termination and receipt of an invoice from Commerce. During the course of
this Agreement, all Royalties and New Account Fees earned by Foundation that exceed five
thousand dollars (US $5,000) will be paid to Foundation within forty-five (45) days of each
month end.

4. Within forty-five (45) days of each month end, Commerce will provide a month end report for the
preceding month showing the detail of monthly sales volume and the number of new activated
Member Accounts upon which Royalties and New Account Fees are calculated.

5. Foundation shall not conduct any new account generation activity nor produce any credit card
product or account related print, electronic or other material without the express oversight and
approval of Commerce.
