Per ADDENDUM No.1 dated 2/27/2015, PSECU agrees to compensate CCP annually $22.50
per square foot (includes utilities) as the prorated cost for occupied space and utility usage for
the Financial Education Center. Having been informed at the site visit that the approximate
size of the available space is 350 square feet, we approximate this cost to be $7,875 per year.
Payment structure will be negotiated after award of the final contract.

In addition, PSECU will provide surcharge-free ATMs at all locations mutually agreed upon
by the College and PSECU. Based on the ATM transaction volumes provided in Addendum
No. | and the average surcharge incurred by our members of $2.44, we estimate this provision
to be valued at approximately $788,852 for the life of the contract. PSECU believes this will
contribute to a significant reduction in cost for your campus community to use our ATMs.
