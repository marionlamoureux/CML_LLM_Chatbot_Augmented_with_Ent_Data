Bank upon demand an amount equal to the difference between the total amount of the Advance(s) paid by Bank
and the total amount of accrued Royalties credited by Bank against such Advance(s) as of the date of such
demand, in the event any of the conditions set forth in Clauses (i) through (iv) below should occur:

(i) the Agreement is terminated prior to the end of the Initial Term as stated in this Agreement as of
the Effective Date;

(ii) GUAA breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least six (6) direct mail campaigns to
the full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term;
and

{iv) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least one (1) email campaign to the
full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term.

For the avoidance of doubt, if any of the conditions set forth in (ii) through (iv) above should occur, Bank ceases
to pay any further Advances to GUAA and GUAA repays to Bank an amount equal to the difference between the
total amount of the Advance(s) paid by Bank and the total amount of accrued Royalties credited by Bank against
such Advance(s) as of the date of Bank?s demand of such repayment (i.e., GUAA satisfies Bank?s demand in
subpart (y) above), then for the remainder of the Term (if any) GUAA shall continue accruing Royalties and Bank
shall pay GUAA all Royalties accrued by GUAA in accordance with this Agreement.

2. If during any given year(s) during the Initial Term, Bank recoups all prior Advances paid by it to GUAA in prior
years, and pays GUAA Royalties accrued by GUAA over and above the Royalties used by Bank to recoup such
prior Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?), then Bank may reduce the amount of any subsequent Advance(s) due
by the amount of any such Paid Out Royalties.

F. ROYALTY GUARANTEE

GUAA shall be guaranteed to accrue Eligible Royalties (including the amount of the Advances) equal to or
greater than eight hundred fifteen thousand dollars ($815,000) (the ?Guarantee Amount?) by March 31, 2024,
subject to the provisions set forth below. If on March 31, 2024, GUAA has not accrued $815,000 in Eligible
Royalties, Bank will pay GUAA an amount equal to the Guarantee Amount minus the sum of all compensation
accrued by GUAA up to and including March 31, 2024 and all unrecouped Advances. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Royalty Guarantee and any obligation of Bank hereunder shall be expressly contingent upon the
non-occurrence of any of the conditions set forth in Subsection E.1., above.
