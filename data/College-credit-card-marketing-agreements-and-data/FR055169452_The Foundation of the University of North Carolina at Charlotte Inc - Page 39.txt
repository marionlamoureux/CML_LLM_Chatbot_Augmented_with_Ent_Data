(v) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is subject to receivership, conservatorship or
liquidation; or
(vi) becomes insolvent in that its liabilities exceed its assets;
(vii) ceases to conduct business for a period of over two weeks, except in the case of a force majeure event;
or
(viii) assigns this Agreement in a manner not consistent with Section 12(g),

then the other Party may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice given by
such Party as provided herein.

(c) Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall, except as set forth in
Subsection 11(d), cease to use the UNCCAA Trademarks and University Trademarks for Program marketing
purposes, provided that Bank may conclude all solicitations required by Applicable Law. Upon the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall not claim any right, title, or interest in or to the UNCCAA
Trademarks, University Trademarks or to the Marketing Lists. The provisions of this Subsection 11(c) shall
survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(d) Bank shall have the right to prior review and approval of any notice in connection with, relating or
referring to the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement to be communicated by or on behalf of
Foundation and UNCCAA or any Foundation Affiliate and UNCCAA Affiliate to the Members. Upon expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall have until the later of (i) 120 days from the termination or
expiration date or (ii) as soon as operationally reasonable by the Bank to: (x) suspend marketing and remove
marketing materials from Bank?s marketing channels; (y) use UNCCAA Trademarks and University Trademarks
(including Program Trademarks that consist of or contain UNCCAA Trademarks and University Trademarks) in
connection with existing Deposit Accounts, Credit Card Accounts and those opened during such period; and, (z)
remove UNCCAA Trademarks and University Trademarks from Program collateral and account materials in
Bank?s possession, such as statements, welcome packages, and card carriers. Foundation and UNCCAA shall not
attempt to cause the removal of UNCCAA Trademarks and University Trademarks from any Person?s credit
devices, debit devices, checks or records of any Customer existing as of the day immediately following the
expiration or earlier termination of the Term. Bank shall have the right to use UNCCAA Trademarks and
University Trademarks on such credit devices, debit devices, checks and records until their normally scheduled
reissue date or exhaustion and issue credit cards bearing UNCCAA Trademarks and University Trademarks until
such date. The provisions of this Subsection 11(d) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement.

(e) If Applicable Law has or could have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses (including the
businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined in Bank?s
sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify Foundation and UNCCAA in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the
terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If, within 30 business days after Foundation and UNCCAA?s receipt
of Bank?s notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory to
both Parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card Program, or
the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to Foundation and UNCCAA, upon 90 days advance
written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card Program is
terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 11(e), such terminated program
remains subject to the Sections in the Agreement that by its express terms are meant to survive the expiration
or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations in any other provision of this Agreement
with respect to the products offered under such program shall be null and void, in each case as if the
termination of such program was a termination or expiration of the Agreement for just that program.
