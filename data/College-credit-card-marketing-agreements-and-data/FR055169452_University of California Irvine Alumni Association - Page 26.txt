foregoing, (x) Bank shall no longer be obligated to pay any additional Advances to UCIAA hereunder, and
(y) UCIAA hereby promises to pay Bank upon demand an amount equal to the difference between the
total amount of the Advance({s) paid by Bank and the total amount of accrued Eligible Royalties credited
by Bank against such Advance(s) as of the date of such demand, in the event any of the conditions set
forth in Clauses (i) through (v) below should occur:

(i) the Agreement is terminated prior to the end of the Term as stated in this Agreement as of the
Effective Date;

(ii) UCIAA breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least six (6) direct mail campaigns to
the full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term;

(iv) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least two (2) e-mail campaigns to the
full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term; and

(v) Bank shall not be prohibited from conducting promotion campaigns at major UCIAA events during
each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term.

2. If during any given year(s) during the Initial Term of this Agreement Bank recoups all prior Advances paid
by it to UCIAA in prior years, and pays UCIAA Eligible Royalties accrued by UCIAA over and above the
Eligible Royalties used by Bank to recoup such prior Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?), then Bank may
reduce the amount of any subsequent Advance(s} due by the amount of any such Paid Out Royalties.

ROYALTY GUARANTEE

UCIAA shall be guaranteed to accrue Eligible Royalties (including the amount of the Advances) equal to
or greater than one hundred ninety thousand dollars ($190,000.00) (the ?Guarantee Amount?) by
August 31, 2022, subject to the provisions set forth below. If on August 31, 2022 UCIAA has not accrued
$190,000.00 in Eligible Royalties, Bank will pay UCIAA an amount equal to the Guarantee Amount minus
the sum of all compensation accrued by UCIAA during the Term and all unrecouped Advances.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Royalty Guarantee and any obligation of Bank hereunder shall be
expressly contingent upon the non-occurrence of any of the conditions set forth in Subsection E.1.,
above.
