obtained hereunder to fund or engage in any activities with any Person or in any country or territory,
that, at the time of such funding or activity, is the subject of Sanctions, or in any other manner that will
result in a violation by any Person of Sanctions. The provisions of this Subsection 4(c) shall survive the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement

ROYALTIES

(a) During the Term and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Bank shall pay
Royalties as described in Schedule A to Alumni Association with respect to accounts in good standing.

{b) No compensation or payments shall be paid to Alumni Association until a Schedule B (W-9 Form
and ACH Form) or other IRS required form (e.g., W-8) is fully completed and returned to Bank. Except as
otherwise provided in Schedule A, payment of Royalties (along with delivery of Bank?s Royalty report)
then due shall be made, in arrears, approximately 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter.

(c) if at any time during the Term any change in any card network?s interchange rate(s) or similar
rate(s), when measured separately or together with all other rate changes since the Effective Date, has
more than a de minimis adverse impact on Bank?s businesses (including the businesses of any Bank
Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined by Bank in its sole
discretion (?Impact?), then Bank may notify Alumni Association in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate
the Royalties and any other financial terms in the Agreement to address the Impact. If, within 30
business days after Alumni Association?s receipt of Bank?s notice, the Parties have not, for whatever
reason, fully executed an addendum that modifies the Royalties and other financial terms to address the
Impact, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card Program,
or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to Alumni Association, upon 90 days
advance written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit
Card Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 5(c), such
terminated program remains subject to the applicable survival provisions, if any and any other Section
that by its terms are meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the
rights and obligations in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered
under such program shall be null and void, in each case as if the termination of such program was a
termination or expiration of the Agreement for just that program.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Bank will not be required to pay
Royalties or any other compensation to Alumni Association with regard to, as a result of opening, or

based upon any student Credit Card Accounts.

PROGRAM ADJUSTMENTS

Bank has the right to make periodic adjustments to the Program, including changes to its terms and
features (including the terms and features of the Financial Service Products offered pursuant to the
Program). For the purpose of clarification, this Section 6 does not provide Bank the right to change the
terms of this Agreement except by written agreement of the Parties.

CONFIDENTIALITY
(a) The terms of this Agreement, any proposal, financial information, performance information,
proprietary information {including trade secrets), legally privileged information and information of third

parties provided by or on behalf of one Party to any other Party (or, to the extent applicable, its
