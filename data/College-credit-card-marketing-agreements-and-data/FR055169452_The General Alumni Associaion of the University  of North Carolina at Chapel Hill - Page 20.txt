to pay any additional Advances to GAA hereunder, and (y) GAA hereby promises to pay Bank upon demand an
amount equal to the difference between the total amount of the Advance(s) paid by Bank and the total amount
of accrued Eligible Royalties credited by Bank against such Advance(s) as of the date of such demand, in the
event any of the conditions set forth in Clauses (i) through (v) below should occur:

(i) the Agreement is terminated prior to the end of March 31, 2024 as stated in this Agreement,
(ii) GAA breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least six (6) direct mail campaigns to

(iv) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least one (1) e-mail campaign to the
full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the term of the
Agreement.

2. If during any given year(s) during the Term Bank recoups all prior Advances paid by it to GAA in prior
years, and pays GAA Eligible Royalties accrued by GAA over and above the Eligible Royalties used by Bank to
recoup such prior Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?), then Bank may reduce the amount of any subsequent
Advance(s) due by the amount of any such Paid Out Royalties.

F. ROYALTY GUARANTEE

GAA Shall be guaranteed to accrue Eligible Royalties (including without limitation the amount of the Advances)
equal to or greater than four million one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($4,125,000.00) (the ?Guarantee
Amount?) by March 31, 2022, subject to the provisions set forth below. If on March 31, 2022, GAA has not
accrued four million one hundred twenty five thousand dollars ($4,125,000.00) in Eligible Royalties, Bank will
pay GAA an amount equal to the Guarantee Amount minus the sum of all compensation accrued by GAA during
the Term and all unrecouped Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Royalty Guarantee and any
obligation of Bank hereunder shail be expressly contingent upon the non-occurrence of any of the conditions set
forth in Subsection E.1., above.
