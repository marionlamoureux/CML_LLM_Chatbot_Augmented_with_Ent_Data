soon as operationally reasonable by the Bank to: (x) suspend marketing and remove marketing materials
from Bank?s marketing channels; (y) use Licensed Trademarks in connection with existing Deposit
Accounts, Credit Card Accounts and those opened during such period; and, (z) remove Licensed
Trademarks from Program collateral and account materials in Bank?s or its Affiliates? possession, such as
statements, welcome packages, and card carriers. UICA shall not attempt to cause the removal of
Licensed Trademarks from any Person?s credit devices, debit devices, checks or records of any Customer
existing as of the day 90 days immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of the Term.
Bank shall have the right to use Licensed Trademarks on such credit devices, debit devices, checks and
records until their normally scheduled reissue date or exhaustion and issue credit cards bearing Licensed
Trademarks a until such date. The provisions of this Subsection 11(d) shall survive the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement.

(e) If Applicable Law has or could have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses (including the
businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined in
Bank?s sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify UICA in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the
terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If, within 30 business days after UICA?s receipt of Bank?s
notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory to
both Parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card
Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to UICA, upon 90 days advance
written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card
Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 11(e), such
terminated program remains subject to the Sections in the Agreement that by its express terms are
meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program shall
be null and void, in each case as if the termination of such program was a termination or expiration of
the Agreement for just that program.

(f) For the 1 year period immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement for any reason, UICA agrees that neither UICA nor any UICA Affiliate shall, by itself or in
conjunction with others, directly or indirectly, target any offer of a Financial Service Product or a related
product to persons who were Customers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, UICA may, after the expiration
or earlier termination of this Agreement, offer persons who were Customers the opportunity to
participate in another financial service program endorsed by UICA, provided the opportunity is not only
made available to such persons but rather as a part of a general solicitation to all Members and
provided further that persons are not directly or indirectly identified as a customer of Bank, or offered
any terms or incentives that differ from those offered to all Members. The provisions of this Subsection
11(f) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(g) If ordered or requested to do so by any Governmental Authority, Bank may terminate this
Agreement without further obligation or penalty upon reasonable prior notice to UICA effective as of
the date specified in such notice or as required by such Governmental Authority.

{h) Within 60 days after expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, UICA agrees that it
shall (and shall cause its Subcontractors and their respective Representatives to): (i) promptly destroy
and purge from all its systems all Bank Information, including Nonpublic Personal Information; and (ii)
return or destroy all such Bank Information that is in tangible form, including any and all full or partial
copies, or reproductions thereof in any medium whatsoever. UICA shall (and shall cause its
Subcontractors and their respective Representatives to) destroy all such Bank Information in accordance
with Bank's then-current destruction policy. UICA shall have the right to retain a copy of Information of
Bank only to the extent required by Applicable Law or as is necessary in connection with the Bank?s
