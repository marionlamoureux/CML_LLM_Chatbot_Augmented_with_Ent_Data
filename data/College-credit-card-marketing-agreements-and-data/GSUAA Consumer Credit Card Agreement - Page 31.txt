ARTICLE 1: Incentives on Accounts

1.1 For each new Account that is opened with APCU through this Agreement, GSUAA
will earn a one-time incentive of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) (?Incentive?). The total number of
Incentives earned in one month will be paid to GSUAA the following month.

1.2 Based on the total number of Purchases per month made by all Accountholders who
opened an Account through this program, GSUAA shall earn a transaction interchange income
(?Interchange Income?) of one percent (1.00%) to a maximum of fifteen percent (15.00%) per
month according to the following percentages:

(a) at 1 ? 2,500 purchases per month, one percent (1.00%) of the Interchange

Income will be paid to GSUAA;

(b) at 2,501 ? 5,000 purchases per month, two and fifty percent (2.50%) of the

Interchange Income will be paid to GSUAA;

(c) at 5,001 ? 7,500 purchases per month, five percent (5.00%) of the Interchange
income will be paid to GSUAA;
(d) at 7,501 ? 15,000 purchases per month, ten percent (10.00%) of the Interchange

Income will be paid to GSUAA;

(e) at 15,000 purchases per month or more, fifteen percent (15.00%) of the

Interchange Income will be paid to GSUAA.

The Incentives and Interchange Income is derived from an internal executive report
compiled by APCU. Merchandise returns, credits, and amounts in dispute are deducted from the
total purchase volume to calculate the transaction interchange income.

?Purchases,? as used in this section, refer to transactions for goods or services and excludes
cash advances and quasi-cash transactions such as, but not limited to, traveler's checks,
convenience checks, wire transfers, money orders, balance transfers, or fees or premiums for

coverage or insurance to protect the balances of a Member?s Account.
