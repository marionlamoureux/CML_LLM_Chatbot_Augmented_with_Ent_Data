Timeliness. A payment from USAA to NAVY ENTITIES shall be considered timely with
respect to any due date determined in accordance with the Business Agreement if USAA
initiates the Entry no later than such payment due date. However, if financial institutions are
not open for business on such payment due date, USAA?s payment shall be deemed timely if
the Entry is initiated on the next day financial institutions are open for business.

Partial Payments. Notwithstanding any statement contained in any Remittance Information to
the contrary, the completion of any funds transfer hereunder shall not constitute full
satisfaction of USAA?s obligations if the amount paid is less than that required by the
underlying business obligation owed by USAA to NAVY ENTITIES.

Security Procedures. Payment instructions and Remittance Information exchanged shall be
solely used for the purpose intended under the terms of the Business Agreement and shall not
be made available for any other purposes. Each party shall employ reasonable security
procedures to ensure that payment instructions, Remittance Information, notices and other
information specified herein that are electronically created, communicated, processed, stored,
retained or retrieved are authentic, accurate, reliable, complete, and reasonably protected from
access, use or modification by persons not specifically authorized to carry out the purposes of
the Business Agreement.

Questions and Errors. In the event of any question or error relating to Entries initiated, NAVY
ENTITIES should contact the Accounts Payable hotline at (210) 498-2288.
