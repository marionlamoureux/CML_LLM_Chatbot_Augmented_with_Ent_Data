the Recipient through lawful means; (c) is obtained by the Recipient after the time of disclosure from a
third party who is free to make such disclosure without restriction; (d) was independently developed by
an employee of the Recipient that has not had access directly or indirectly to Information; or (e) is
disclosed pursuant to a lawful order or request of a court, regulatory agency, or accrediting body,
provided that the Recipient has given prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party to enable the
disclosing Party to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure and, in the
event that the Disclosing Party is unable to prevent or restrict such disclosure, has only disclosed that
portion of the Information that it is legally required to disclose. The Recipient acknowledges that the
loss arising from a breach of these confidentiality obligations cannot adequately be compensated solely
by money damages and will cause the Disclosing Party to suffer irreparable harm, such that a remedy at
law for breach would not be adequate, and that the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek injunctive
relief for such breach in addition to all other available remedies.

(b) A Recipient shall be permitted to disclose such Information (i) to its Agents as necessary for the
performance of their respective duties, provided that such Agents agree to treat the Information as
confidential and such Agent is subject to enforceable confidentiality provisions at least as restrictive in
this Agreement or (ii) as required by Applicable Law or requested by any Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient shall be liable for any breach of the Section by its Agents.

(c) Each Recipient shall keep (and shall require its Subcontractors and their respective
Representatives to keep) all Information (including Nonpublic Personal Information) confidential and
shall not make any copies of any kind or transfer, provide, trade, give away, barter, lend, send, sell, or
otherwise disclose (collectively ?transfer?) (and shall require its Subcontractors and their respective
Representatives not to make or transfer) any such information to any other entity or individual for any
reason, (i) except as required by this Agreement or for uses agreed to in writing by the Disclosing Party
prior to any such transfer or (ii) with respect to Bank, except as required or permitted by Applicable Law
or Governmental Authority or in a manner implemented by Bank from time to time in the exercise of its
reasonable judgment and consistently applied across its US retail consumer credit card program. For the
avoidance of doubt, each Party shall be liable for any breach of this Section by its Subcontractors and
their respective Representatives. If a Recipient receives a request or demand to disclose Information
(including Nonpublic Personal Information) pursuant to a subpoena, order of court of competent
jurisdiction or by judicial or administrative agency or legislative body or committee, the Recipient will
(with respect to Bank, only to the extent permitted by Applicable Law or Governmental Authority): (i)
immediately notify the Disclosing Party of the existence, terms, and circumstances surrounding such
request; (ii) consult with the Disclosing Party on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist
or narrow such request; and (iii) if disclosure of such information is required or deemed advisable,
exercise its best efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of such information to be disclosed that the other Party designates.

(d) During the Term and thereafter until NYU and its Subcontractors and their respective
Representatives and Agents no longer have in their possession or control Bank?s Information NYU will
have, maintain and routinely assess (and require its Subcontractors and their respective Representatives
and Agents to have, maintain and routinely assess) an information security program that is designed,
among other things, to: (i) ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of confidential information,
including Information (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of
confidential information, including Information, which includes the use of up-to-date commercially
available virus and malicious code detection and protection products; (iii) protect against unauthorized
access to or use of confidential information, including Information, that could result in substantial harm
