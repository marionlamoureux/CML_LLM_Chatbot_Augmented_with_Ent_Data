Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in connection with any examination or other supervisory
activity by such Governmental Authority.

Neither any submission of this document by one Party to the other, nor any correspondence or other
communications between the Parties in connection therewith, is intended or shall be deemed to
constitute an offer of any kind or to create any obligations between the Parties unless and until one or
more duplicates of this document has been fully executed and delivered between the Parties hereto,
whereupon this document shall become the binding Agreement. Accordingly, any such submission or
communications or correspondence between the Parties or their respective agents or attorneys is
intended only as non-binding discussions, and either Party shall have the absolute right to withdraw from
such discussions at any time without any liability whatsoever to the other Party.

Each Party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this agreement
or any related agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such
Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to a trial by jury with
respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this agreement or any related
agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this agreement or any related agreement. Each Party
hereto certifies and acknowledges that (a) no Representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to
enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) such Party understands and has considered the implications of this
waiver, (c) such Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) such Party has been induced to enter into
this agreement and each related agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Subsection. The provisions of this Subsection 12(p) shall survive the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement.

Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or
reserved to either Party (including any termination pursuant to Section 11) is intended to be exclusive of
any other right or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to
any other right or remedy under this Agreement, or under law or regulation, whether now or hereafter

existing. The provisions of this Subsection 12(q) shall survive the expiration of earlier termination of this
Agreement.

Except as expressly provided otherwise in the proviso to this Subsection 12(r), neither Party shall be
liable to the other for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages,
including, but not limited to, lost profits, even if such Party alleged to be liable has knowledge of the
possibility of such damages, provided, however, that the limitations set forth in this Subsection shall not
apply to or in any way limit the obligations of a Party?s gross negligence or willful misconduct (or the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of its subcontractors, and its and their respective Representatives).
The provisions of this Subsection 12(r) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement.
