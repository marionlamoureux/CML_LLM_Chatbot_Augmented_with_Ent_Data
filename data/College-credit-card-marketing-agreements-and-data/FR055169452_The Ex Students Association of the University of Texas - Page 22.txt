fully recouped. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Bank shall no longer be obligated to pay any additional
Advances to ESAUT hereunder, and (y) ESAUT hereby promises to pay Bank upon demand an amount equal to
the difference between the total amount of the Advance(s) paid by Bank and the total amount of accrued
Royalties credited by Bank against such Advance(s) as of the date of such demand, in the event any of the
conditions set forth in Clauses (i) through (iv) below should occur:

(i) the Agreement is terminated prior to the end of the Initial Term as stated in this Agreement as of
the Effective Date;

(ii) ESAUT breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least six (6) direct mail campaigns to
the full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term;
and

(iv) Bank shall not be prohibited from conducting promotion campaigns at major ESAUT events during
each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term.

2. If during any given year(s) during the Initial Term of this Agreement Bank recoups all prior Advances paid
by it to ESAUT in prior years, and pays ESAUT Eligible Royalties accrued by ESAUT over and above the
Eligible Royalties used by Bank to recoup such prior Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?), then Bank may
reduce the amount of any subsequent Advance(s) due by the amount of any such Paid Out Royalties.

F. ROYALTY GUARANTEE

ESAUT shall be guaranteed to accrue Eligible Royalties (including the amount of the Advances) equal to or
greater than three million seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($3,750,000.00) (the ?Guarantee
Amount?) by June 30, 2024, subject to the provisions set forth below. If on June 30, 2024 ESAUT has not
accrued $3,750,000.00 in Eligible Royalties, Bank will pay ESAUT an amount equal to the Guarantee
Amount minus the sum of all Royalties (but excluding those Royalties that accrue and are payable
pursuant to Sections A.4, B.4, and C.4 of Schedule A) accrued by ESAUT during the Term and all
unrecouped Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Royalty Guarantee and any obligation of Bank
hereunder shall be expressly contingent upon the non-occurrence of any of the conditions set forth in
Subsection E.1., above.
