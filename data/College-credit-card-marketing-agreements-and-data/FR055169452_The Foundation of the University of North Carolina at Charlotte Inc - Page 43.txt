(I) Neither Party shall be held responsible for any delay or failure in performance to the extent such delay
or failure is caused by fire, flood, explosion, terrorism, war, strike, embargo, government laws, rules, regulations
or requirements, civil or military authority, act of God, act or omission of carriers, pandemic, epidemic, or other
similar causes beyond its control, that was not reasonably foreseeable or avoidable, and without the fault or
negligence and/or lack of diligence of the delayed Party (?force majeure condition?). The non-delayed Party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if such force majeure condition endures for more than 120 days
by providing the delayed Party with least 30 days prior written notice of such termination, which notice must be
received by the delayed Party within 10 days after the expiration of the 120 day period.

(m) This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The Parties agree to accept a
digital image of this Agreement, as executed, as a true and correct original and admissible as best evidence to the
extent permitted by a court with proper jurisdiction. The Parties agree that if a representative of each of the
Parties signs this Agreement (whether manually or electronically) and transmits such Agreement to the other
Party or Parties via facsimile or electronically transmitted portable document format, the Agreement shall be
treated in all manner and respects as having an original signature (or counterpart thereof) and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. At the request of a Party, each other Party hereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver
them to all other Parties. No Party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine, electronic signature or electronic
transmission in portable document format or the fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated
through the use of facsimile machine or electronic transmission in portable document format as a defense to this
Agreement and each such Person forever waives any such defense. The provisions of this Subsection 12(m) shall
survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

communications between the Parties in connection therewith, is intended or shall be deemed to constitute an
offer of any kind or to create any obligations between the Parties unless and until one or more duplicates of this
document has been fully executed and delivered between the Parties hereto, whereupon this document shall
become the binding Agreement. Accordingly, any such submission or communications or correspondence
between the Parties or their respective agents or attorneys is intended only as non-binding discussions, and
either Party shall have the absolute right to withdraw from such discussions at any time without any liability
whatsoever to the other Party.

Agreement or any related agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each
such Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to a trial by jury with
