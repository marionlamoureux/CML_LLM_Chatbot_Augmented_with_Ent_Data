(c) Upon written notification from the Commonwealth that it requires the Contractor's
assistance in responding to a request under the RTKL for information related to this
Contract that may be in the Contractor?s possession, constituting, or alleged to
constitute, a public record in accordance with the RTKL (?Requested Information?), the
Contractor shall:

1) Provide the Commonwealth, within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of written
notification (unless an extension is otherwise granted to the Commonwealth and
the Contractor), access to, and copies of, any document or information in the
Contractor's possession arising out of this Contract that the Commonwealth
reasonably believes is Requested Information and may be a public record under
the RTKL; and

2) Provide such other reasonable assistance as the Commonwealth may reasonably
request, in order to comply with the RTKL with respect to this Contract.

(d) If the Contractor considers the Requested Information to include a request for a Trade
Secret or Confidential Proprietary Information, as those terms are defined by the RTKL,
or other information that the Contractor considers exempt from production under the
RTKL, the Contractor must notify the Commonwealth and provide, within seven (7)
calendar days of receiving the written notification (unless an extension is otherwise
granted to the Commonwealth and the Contractor), a written statement signed by a
representative of the Contractor explaining why the Requested Information is exempt
from public disclosure under the RTKL.

(e) The Commonwealth will rely upon the written statement from the Contractor in
denying a RTKL request for the Requested Information unless the Commonwealth
determines that the Requested Information is clearly not protected from disclosure
under the RTKL. Should the Commonwealth determine that the Requested Information
is clearly not exempt from disclosure, the Commonwealth shall provide written
notification of such determination to the Contractor and the Contractor shall provide
the Requested Information within five (5) business days of receipt of such written
notification of the Commonwealth?s determination (unless an extension is otherwise
granted to the Commonwealth and the Contractor).

(f) If the Contractor fails to provide the Requested Information within the time period
required by these provisions, the Contractor shall indemnify and hold the
Commonwealth harmless for any damages, penalties, costs, detriment or harm that the
Commonwealth may incur as a result of the Contractor?s failure, including any statutory
damages assessed against the Commonwealth.

(g) The Commonwealth will reimburse the Contractor for any costs associated with
complying with these provisions only to the extent allowed under the fee schedule
established by the Office of Open Records or as otherwise provided by the RTKL if the
fee schedule is inapplicable.
