Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to GUAA, upon 90 days advance
written notice, For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card

terminated program remains subject to the Sections in the Agreement that by its express terms are
meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program shall
be null and void, in each case as if the termination of such program was a termination or expiration of
the Agreement for just that program.

(f) Upon expiration of the Agreement or termination due to Bank?s breach, Bank will pay to GUAA
and/or apply against unrecouped Advances any Royalties (as described in Schedule A) accrued but
unpaid as of the termination or expiration date, as applicable, unless such termination resulted from a
breach of this Agreement by GUAA. Any payment as may be due GUAA at such time in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement should be made to GUAA as soon as practicable after the termination or
expiration date, as applicable.

product to persons who were Customers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GUAA may, after the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, offer persons who were Customers the opportunity
to participate in another financial service program offered pursuant to a licensing agreement with
GUAA, provided the opportunity is not only made available to such persons but rather as a part of a
general solicitation to all Members and provided further that persons are not directly or indirectly

the date specified in such notice or as required by such Governmental Authority.
