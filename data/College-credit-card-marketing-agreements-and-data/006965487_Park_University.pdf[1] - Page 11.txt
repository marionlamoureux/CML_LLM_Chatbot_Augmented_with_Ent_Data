documents and information relating to or presented during the mediation proceedings'
shall be deemed to be information subject to the confidentiality provisions of this
Agreement. The mediator will have no power or authority to relieve the Parties from
their agreement hereunder to mediate or otherwise to amend or disregard any provision
of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section 14.

Should a mediator refuse or be unable to proceed with Mediation proceedings as called
