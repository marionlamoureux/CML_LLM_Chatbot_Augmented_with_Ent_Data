provided, however, that this Section 15.2 will not be construed to prevent a Party
from instituting formal proceedings earlier to avoid the expiration of any

Party shall file, and serve on the Disputing Party, a written statement:

15.5.1 answering the claims set forth in the Mediation Demand and including any
affirmative defenses of such Party; and

15.5.2 asserting any counterclaim, which shall

(a) describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Dispute relating to the
counterclaim;

(b) state the amount of the counterclaim, and

(c) specify the requested relief.
