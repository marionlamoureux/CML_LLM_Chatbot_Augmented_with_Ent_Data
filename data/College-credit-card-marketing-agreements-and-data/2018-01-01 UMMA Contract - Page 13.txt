character of Credit Union provided such review and approval shall not be required
for a termination following a breach by Credit Union: Such approval will not be
unreasonably withheld. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement,
Credit Union will have up to six (6) calendar months from the termination or
expiration date to: (i) suspend marketing and remove marketing materials from
Credit Union's marketing channels; (ii) shall have up to twelve (12) months to
remove Trademarks from Program collateral and account materials, such as
statements, welcome packages, reissued or replaced credit devices, and card
carriers. Alummi Association shall not attempt to cause the removal of
Trademarks from any person's credit devices or records of any Customer existing
as of termination date or expiration date of this Agreement, and Credit Union
shall have the right to use Trademarks on such credit devices, and records until
their normally scheduled reissue date or replacement or exhaustion.

If Applicable Law has or will have a material adverse effect on Credit Union's
businesses (including the businesses of any Credit Union Affiliate providing a
product or service under this Agreement), as determined in Credit Union's sole
discretion ("Event"), Credit Union may notify Alumni Association in writing of
Credit Union's desire to renegotiate the terms of the Agreement to address the
Event. If, within thirty (30) business days after Alumni Association's receipt of
Credit Union's notice, the parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an
addendum that is satisfactory to both parties, Credit Union shall have the right to
terminate either the Credit Card Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without
penalty or liability to Alumni Association, upon ninety (90) days advance written
notice. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Credit Card Program is terminated
earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Section 11(e), such terminated
program remains subject to the provisions described in the sections referenced in
Section 11(d) of the Agreement and any other section in the Agreement that by its
terms are meant to survive the termination of this Agreement, and the rights and
obligations in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products
offered under such program shall be null and void, in each case, as if the
termination of such program was a termination or expiration of the Agreement for
just that program.

For a one (1) year period immediately following the termination of this
Agreement, Alumni Association agrees that neither Alumni Association, nor any
Alumni Association Affiliate will, by itself or in conjunction with others, directly
or indirectly, target any offer of Credit Card Services to persons who were
Customers provided the foregoing shall not apply to termination resulting from a
material breach by Credit Union. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Alumni
Association, or any Alumni Association Affiliate may, after the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement, offer persons who were Customers the
opportunity to participate in another credit card service endorsed by Alumni
Association, or any Alumni Association Affiliate, provided the opportunity is not
only made available to such persons but rather as a part of a general solicitation to
all Members and provided further that persons are not directly or indirectly
