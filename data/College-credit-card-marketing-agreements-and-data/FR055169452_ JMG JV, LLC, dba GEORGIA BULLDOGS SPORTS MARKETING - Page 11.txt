(h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, JMG acknowledges and
agrees that Bank may market any financial service products or services that Bank or any Bank Affiliate
offers (e.g., credit cards and deposit products, collectively ?Bank Products?) that do not incorporate any
UGAA Trademarks or University Trademarks contemporaneously with the promotion of Deposits and
that such Bank Products are not subject to this Agreement. However, when using Marketing Lists for
Deposit Accounts, Bank agrees that it shall not market Bank Products (excluding Deposit Offers, as
defined below), in direct mail copy, in an e-mail or an outbound telemarketing solicitation, unless JMG
consents in writing (email shall suffice) to Bank?s use of the Marketing Lists for such purposes. ?Deposit
Offers? means any and all Deposits benefits and features and any and all other products and services
that relate to or have a connection with Deposits (e.g., Online Banking and $0 Trade). Bank may
maintain separately all information it obtains as a result of an account application for, and/or an account
relationship in connection with, Deposits or a Bank Product. All such information becomes a part of
Bank?s own files and shall not be subject to the Agreement.

(i) In connection with Bank?s activities hereunder, Bank shall not use the name, image, or likeness
of any current or former University student-athlete, coach, or administrator.
