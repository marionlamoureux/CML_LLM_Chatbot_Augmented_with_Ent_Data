Bank shall be entitled to sub-contract any of the Services under this Agreement. Bank
shall not by virtue of entering into any sub-contract avoid liability for any acts and
defaults of its agents and sub-contractors for which it would otherwise have been liable.

INDEPENDENT PARTIES

Bank and you (and for the avoidance of doubt, each of the Bank and the Card
Association) are not agents, representatives, partners or employees of the other, and
neither Party will have the power to obligate or bind the other in any manner except as
otherwise expressly provided by this Agreement.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Any dispute between the Parties arising under or in connection with this Agreement or
any breach of this Agreement (a "Dispute") shall be resolved solely in accordance with
the procedures in this Section 15.

Any Dispute under this Agreement whether based on contract, tort, common law,

representative whose task it will be to meet for the purpose of endeavoring to
resolve such Dispute;

15.2.2 the designated representatives shall meet as often as the Parties reasonably
deem necessary to discuss the problem in an effort to resolve the Dispute
without the necessity of any formal proceeding; and

15.2.3 formal proceedings for the resolution of a Dispute may not be commenced until
the earlier of:

(a) the designated representatives concluding in good faith that amicable
resolution through continued negotiation of the matter does not appear
likely; or

(b) the expiration of the thirty (30) day period immediately following the initial
request to negotiate the Dispute;

applicable limitations period, to preserve a superior position with respect to other
creditors or to seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief pursuant to Section
15.10.

If the Parties are unable to resolve any Dispute as contemplated by Section 15.2, such
Dispute shall be submitted to non-binding mediation at the election of either Party (the
"Disputing Party").

To initiate the mediation, the Disputing Party shall notify the other Party in writing (the
"Mediation Demand"), which shall
