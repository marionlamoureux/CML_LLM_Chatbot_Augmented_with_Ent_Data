(2) THE LIABILITY LIMITATION SET FORTH IN (1) ABOVE SHALL NOT

(t) As of the Effective Date, the Parties hereby agree that the Previous Agreement is terminated, and
the Parties, rights and obligations with respect to the Program shall be governed by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Previous Agreement shall govern the Parties?
relationship with respect to any claim or obligation arising prior to the Effective Date.

ACCOUNTHOLDER LIST

(a) If no notice of termination has been given by either Party, and no event of default of UCIAA has
occurred, or would have occurred but for the giving of notice or the passage of time or both, during the
Term, Bank will, from time to time as agreed by the Parties, furnish an Accountholder List to UCIAA.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Bank will not be required furnish and
may restrict UCIAA?s use of any Accountholder List or Accountholder Information, if Bank is prohibited
from disclosing the same or permitting such use because of Applicable Law, bank-wide privacy policy,
public privacy pledge, or individual present or former Accountholder request, or if furnishing the
Accountholder List or Accountholder Information or its intended use would create an additional
regulatory or compliance burden on Bank.

(b) UCIAA will not use the Accountholder List for any purpose not expressly permitted by Bank in
this Agreement or in a separate writing prepared by Bank and delivered from time to time to UCIAA.
UCIAA will secure the Accountholder List in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and,
Bank?s instructions as communicated by Bank to UCIAA from time to time. UCIAA will only permit access
to the Accountholder List to those employees of UCIAA who need such access to perform their duties
relating to this Agreement. UCIAA will inform such employees of UCIAA?s duties and limitations under
this Agreement, and enforce compliance therewith.

(c) Any Accountholder List furnished to UCIAA may contain dummy information (e.g., names,
account information, addresses, etc., unknown to UCIAA.) for the purpose of detecting unauthorized use
of an Accountholder List. A violation of this Section is conclusively proven and the relief specified below
will be deemed owed when Bank establishes the following conditions: (i) that Bank placed dummy
information on the list (e.g., name(s), account information, address(es)); (ii) that the dummy information
received any mailings which were sent or generated outside the scope of the permitted use of the
Accountholder List; and (iii) that identical dummy information was not furnished by Bank or its affiliates
to any third-party.
