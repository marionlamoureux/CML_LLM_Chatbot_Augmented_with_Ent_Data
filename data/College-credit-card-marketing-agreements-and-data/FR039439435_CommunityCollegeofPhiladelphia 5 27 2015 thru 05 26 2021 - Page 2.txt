Professional personnel ? PSECU first established its campus program in 2000. With 17
campuses in operation, we have never lost or failed to renew a relationship. Our references
will readily confirm the professionalism of our staff.

Soundness of approach ? PSECU believes that an important part of its job on campus is to
teach financial literacy and management skills to its student members. We do this through our
product offerings and training sessions that we host on campus through our Financial Education
Centers.

Facilities ? PSECU manages a fleet of ATMs on college campuses and is certainly prepared to
provide state of the art terminals for Community College of Philadelphia. PSECU will be
providing CCP with ATMs that are surcharge-free for all users as a cost-saving measure for your
campus community.

. Terms and conditions ? PSECU is familiar with college requirements and should have little

difficulty meeting CCP?s contractual terms.

Cost ? PSECU is prepared to offer Community College of Philadelphia a generous proposal free
of many of the conditions set by other financial institutions.

Partnering initiatives ? our unique Financial Education Center approach, using interns hired
from the College for staffing, provides real-world experience for a number of students in the
marketing, sales and finance fields. Should PSECU secure CCP?s business, we will have an office
on campus. With that in mind, the office that will serve the campus community will in effect
be ?0? (zero) geographical miles from the school.

Again, we appreciate the opportunity to participate in this bidding process and look forward to meeting
with you to discuss our proposal in greater detail.

Sincerely,
