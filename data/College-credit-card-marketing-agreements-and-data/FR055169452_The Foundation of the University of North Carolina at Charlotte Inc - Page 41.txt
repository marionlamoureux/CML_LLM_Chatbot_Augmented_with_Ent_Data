privilege. The provisions of this Subsection 12(c) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement.

(d) Titles, captions, and headings included herein are for convenience of reference only and are not to
affect the meaning, construction, or interpretation hereof or of any provision hereof.

(e) It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent
jurisdiction or Governmental Authority to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision,
as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly
drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

receipt, which some recipients might be able to prevent) or at the time that the sender can
demonstrate electronically that the email has been delivered (i.e., by requesting a delivery receipt), or
