any apparent infringement of, or challenge to, the Party?s use of any of the other?s Marks or claim by any Person
of any rights in any of the other Party?s Marks. In such event, the Party providing such notice shall not
communicate with any Person other than the other Party and its counsel in connection with any such
infringement, challenge or claim, unless otherwise authorized by the other Party. As between the Parties, the
owner of the Marks shall have sole discretion to take such action as it deems appropriate in connection with the
foregoing, and the right to control exclusively any settlement, litigation, arbitration or U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office or other proceeding arising out of any such alleged infringement, challenge or claim or
otherwise relating to the owner?s Marks. The Party using the other Party?s Marks agrees to execute any and all
instruments and documents, render such assistance, and do such acts and things as may, in the opinion of
owner?s counsel, be reasonably necessary or advisable to protect and maintain the owner?s interests in any
litigation, proceeding or otherwise relating to any of the owner?s Marks. Any costs associated with such
assistance will be reimbursed by the owner of the Marks to the other Party providing assistance.

or any other presentations that contain references to AOG or USAA or their respective Affiliates in general, or in
relation to the products and services provided under the scope of this Agreement and associated Addenda, unless
the material has been previously reviewed and approved in writing by both parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, either Party may, in its sole and absolute discretion, disapprove any communication that it believes to
be inconsistent with its image. Each Party agrees to promptly update any Mark of the other Party maintained by
such Party regardless of the media in which such Mark is used. If any such use of material presented by USAA
to AOG is not approved or disapproved within ten (10) business days it shall be deemed approved by AOG. If
