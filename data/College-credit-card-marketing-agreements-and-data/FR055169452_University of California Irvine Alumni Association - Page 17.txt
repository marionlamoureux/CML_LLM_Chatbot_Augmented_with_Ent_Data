then the other Party may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice
given by such Party as provided herein.

(c) Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall, except as set forth in
Subsection 11(d), cease to use the UCIAA Trademarks and University Trademarks for Program marketing
purposes, provided that Bank may conclude all solicitations required by Applicable Law. Upon the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall not claim any right, title, or interest in or
to the UCIAA Trademarks, University Trademarks or to the Marketing Lists. The provisions of this
Subsection 11(c) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(d) Bank shall have the right to prior review and approval of any notice in connection with, relating
or referring to the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement to be communicated by or on
behalf of UCIAA or any UCIAA Affiliate to the Members. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this |
Agreement, Bank shall have until the later of (i) 90 days from the termination or expiration date or (ii) as
soon as operationally reasonable by the Bank to: (x) suspend marketing and remove marketing materials
from Bank?s marketing channels; (y) use UCIAA Trademarks and University Trademarks in connection
with existing Deposit Accounts, Credit Card Accounts and those opened during such period; and, (z)
remove UCIAA Trademarks and University Trademarks from Program collateral and account materials in
Bank?s possession, such as statements, welcome packages, and card carriers. UCIAA shall not attempt to
cause the removal of UCIAA Trademarks and University Trademarks from any Person?s credit devices,
debit devices, checks or records of any Customer existing as of 90 days immediately following the
expiration or earlier termination of the Term. Bank shall have the right to use UCIAA Trademarks and
University Trademarks on such credit devices, debit devices, checks and records until their normally
scheduled reissue date or exhaustion and issue credit cards bearing UCIAA Trademarks and University
Trademarks until such date. The provisions of this Subsection 11(d) shall survive the expiration or earlier
termination of this Agreement.

(e) If Applicable Law has or could have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses (including the |
businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined in
Bank?s sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify UCIAA in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the
terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If, within 30 business days after UCIAA?s receipt of Bank?s
notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory to
both Parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card
Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to UCIAA, upon 90 days advance
written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card
Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 11(e), such
terminated program remains subject to the Sections in the Agreement that by its express terms are
meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program shall
be null and void, in each case as if the termination of such program was a termination or expiration of
the Agreement for just that program.

(f) For the 1 year period immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement for any reason, UCIAA agrees that neither UCIAA nor any UCIAA Affiliate shall, by itself or in
conjunction with others, directly or indirectly, target any offer of a Financial Service Product or a related
product to persons who were Customers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, UCIAA may, after the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, offer persons who were Customers the opportunity
to participate in another financial service program endorsed by UCIAA, provided the opportunity is not
only made available to such persons but rather as a part of a general solicitation to all Members and
