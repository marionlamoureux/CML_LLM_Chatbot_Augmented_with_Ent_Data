referring to the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement to be communicated by or on behalf
of GAA or any GAA Affiliate to the Members. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement,

carriers. GAA shall not attempt to cause the removal of GAA Trademarks from any Person?s credit
devices, debit devices, checks or records of any Customer existing as of the day 90 days immediately

Trademarks on such credit devices, debit devices, checks and records until their normally scheduled
reissue date or exhaustion and issue credit cards bearing GAA Trademarks until such date. The
provisions of this Subsection (d) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

If Applicable Law has or could have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses (including the
businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined in
Bank?s sole discretion ("Event?), Bank may notify GAA in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the
terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If, within 30 business days after GAA?s receipt of Bank?s
notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory to
both Parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card
Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to GAA, upon 90 days advance
written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card
Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 11(e), such
terminated program remains subject to the Sections in the Agreement that by its express terms are
meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program shall
be null and void, in each case as if the termination of such program was a termination or expiration of
the Agreement for just that program.

to such persons but rather as a part of a general solicitation to all Members and provided further that
persons are not directly or indirectly identified as a customer of Bank, or offered any terms or incentives
that differ from those offered to all Members. The provisions of this Subsection (f) shall survive the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.
