Agreement (by non-renewal or for any other reason), BECU may continue to allow its BECU
Members to use credit cards co-branded with UWAA Trademarks until such time that each

BECU may reissue credit cards to all such existing co-branded cardholders at one time or as such

shall the reissuance exceed two years from the formal termination of this Agreement. UWAA

continue after formal termination of this Agreement until all such BECU/UWAA Co-branded
Credit Cards are no longer in use by BECU Members.
