until the earlier of: (i) such time as all Advances are fully recouped or (ii) June 30, 2023. Any eligible
royalties accrued thereafter shall be paid to University as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (x) Bank shall no longer be obligated to pay any additional Advances to University
hereunder, and (y) University hereby promises to pay Bank upon demand an amount equal to the
difference between the total amount of the Advance(s) paid by Bank and the total amount of accrued
Eligible Royalties credited by Bank against such Advance(s) as of the date of such demand, in the event
any of the conditions set forth in Clauses (i) through (iv) below should occur:

(i) the Agreement is terminated prior to the end of the Term as stated in this Agreement as of the
Effective Date;

(ii) NYU breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least six (6) direct mail
campaigns to the full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period
during the Term; and

(iv) NYU fails to agree in good faith that Bank may be permitted to conduct promotion campaigns
at major alumni events during the Term in accordance with terms to be set by NYU in its

discretion.

If during any given year(s) during the Initial Term of this Agreement Bank recoups all prior Advances paid
by it to University in prior years, and pays University Eligible Royalties accrued by University over and
above the Eligible Royalties used by Bank to recoup such prior Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?), then
Bank may reduce the amount of any subsequent Advance(s) due by the amount of any such Paid Out
Royalties.

ROYALTY GUARANTEE

University for the benefit of NYUAA shall be guaranteed to accrue Eligible Royalties (including the
amount of the Advances) equal to or greater than three hundred ninety thousand dollars ($390,000.00)
(the ?Guarantee Amount?) by June 30, 2023, subject to the provisions set forth below. If on June 30,
2023 University has not accrued $390,000.00 in Eligible Royalties, Bank will pay University an amount
equal to the Guarantee Amount minus the sum of all compensation accrued by University during the
Term and all unrecouped Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Royalty Guarantee and any
obligation of Bank hereunder shall be expressly contingent upon the non-occurrence of any of the
conditions set forth in Subsection E.1., above.
