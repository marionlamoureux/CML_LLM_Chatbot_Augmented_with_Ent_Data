Potential EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) Transactions - PSECU is always looking for

opportunities to improve upon our current service offerings to our members, whether that is in
the form of enhancing our current products and services or the creation of any new ones. EDI
solutions fall directly into our vision to use technology to provide consumer financial services to
members virtually anytime, anywhere. We have deployed many such services. One of our latest
member-facing services that could be defined under the category of an EDI transaction is our
P2P service, which provides our members the ability to transfer funds from their PSECU
account to a PayPal? account.

Although PSECU does not provide corporate account services such as processing refunds and
financial aid reimbursements, PSECU, as the provider of student banking services, is willing to
coexist on campus with another financial institution providing these other services. Edinboro
University is one of the schools sharing this successful arrangement with us.
