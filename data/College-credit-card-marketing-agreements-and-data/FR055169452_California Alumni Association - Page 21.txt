representative of each of the Parties signs this Agreement (whether manually or electronically) and
transmits such Agreement to the other Party or Parties via facsimile or electronically transmitted
portable document format, the Agreement shall be treated in all manner and respects as having an
original signature (or counterpart thereof) and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects
as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of a Party, each other
Party hereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party shall
raise the use of a facsimile machine, electronic signature or electronic transmission in portable document
format or the fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile

each such Person forever waives any such defense. The provisions of this Subsection 12(m) shall survive
the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

of counsel and other advisors. No provision of this Agreement shall be read, construed or interpreted for

intended only as non-binding discussions, and either Party shall have the absolute right to withdraw from
such discussions at any time without any liability whatsoever to the other Party.
