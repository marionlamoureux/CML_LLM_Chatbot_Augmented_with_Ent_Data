University represents and warrants to Bank as of the date hereof and throughout the term of this
Agreement and any period thereafter that Bank has the right to use the University Trademarks to
wind down the Program that it has the right and power to license University Trademarks to Bank
for use as contemplated by this Agreement, and to provide the Marketing List(s) to Bank for the
promotion of the Program. University will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Bank, and its
directors, officers, agents, employees, Affiliates, successors and assigns, from and against all
liability, causes of action, and claims, and will reimburse Bank?s reasonable and actual costs,
fees and expenses in connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys? fees and court
expenses), arising from the license of University Trademarks herein, or from Bank's use of the
University Trademarks in reliance thereon, or from the use of any Marketing List(s) by Bank for

upon learning of any claims or complaints relating to the license or the use of any University
Trademarks or Marketing Lists.

ROYALTIES

During the term of this Agreement, Bank will pay Royalties to University. Royalties will not be
paid until a Schedule B (W-9 Form and ACH Form) or other IRS required form (e.g., W-8) is
fully completed and returned to Bank. Except as otherwise provided in Schedule A, payment of
Royalties then due will be made sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter.

Pursuant to the trademark license and/or sublicense granted by University to Bank pursuant to
this Agreement, Bank will have the right to use the University Trademarks in connection with all
Financial Service Products offered under the Program during the term of the Agreement.

If at any time during the term of the Agreement any change in any card network?s interchange
rate(s) or similar rate(s), when measured separately or together with all other rate changes since
the Effective Date, has an adverse impact on Bank?s businesses (including the businesses of any
Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as reasonably determined
by Bank (?Impact?), then Bank may notify University in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate
the Royalties and any other financial terms in the Agreement to address the Impact. If, within
thirty (30) business days after University?s receipt of Bank?s notice, the parties have not, for
whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that modifies the Royalties and other financial
terms to address the Impact, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program
or the Credit Card Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to
University, upon ninety (90) days advance written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card Program is terminated earlier than the
Agreement as provided for in this Section 5(c), such terminated program remains subject to the
provisions described in the sections referenced in Section 12(b) of the Agreement and any other
