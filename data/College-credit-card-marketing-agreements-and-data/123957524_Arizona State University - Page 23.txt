Nondiscrimination:

MidFirst shall not subject any person to discrimination in employment, including, hiring, salary, benefits,
advancement, discipline, termination, or retirement on the basis of the individual's reproductive or familial
circumstances. MidFirst shall accommodate the language requirements of their employees to the
greatest extent practicable.

Grievance Process:

Every employee shall be treated with dignity and respect. Conflicts between employees and employers
should be reconciled as amicably and transparently as possible, without the use of coercion or
intimidation. Employees should have the right to express opinions or report complaints as they see fit
without retaliation or the threat of reprisal. MidFirst is encouraged to have a process in place whereby
employees may register specific complaints about the employment practices of that vendor and, if
practicable, to do so in the employee's primary language. If possible, the complainant's identity should be
confidential.
