Summary
A proposed partnership with Carolina Trust and Coastal Carolina Athletics will pave the way for a broadened
scope of exposure for both respective brands. With this proposed partnership, sports fans locally, around the
state and throughout the region will be given a steady view into what Carolina Trust offers while also promoting a
first class collegiate athletics program. This proposal offers an array of opportunities.

As a member of the Sun Belt Conference, our respective brands will be viewed by sports fans throughout the
Grand Strand, Carolinas and of course, stretching all the way into Texas and nationwide; benefitting both local
and statewide sales. Many of CCU?s games will be broadcast not just statewide but also nationally through various
ESPN platforms. As a member of the Sun Belt Conference, all home football games will be broadcast on at least
ESPN+. Moving forward, the likelihood of games on linear ESPN platforms like ESPN, ESPN2, ESPU are very strong.

With an annual economic impact of over $600 million ($1.6million daily) throughout the Grand Strand alone,
Coastal Carolina University and our Chanticleer fans (and visiting fans) have a sizable buying power. Furthermore,
with a demographic breakdown of 48% of students from out-of-state and over 50 countries represented
worldwide, our 10,000+ students represent diverse and broad economic backgrounds ? families that offer
tremendous buying power.
