Cost to the Consumer

PSECU believes a member should not pay to use their account, and has adopted a low- or no-fee philosophy.
University students, faculty and staff will incur few or no costs related to the products and services associated
with their PSECU account. As part of our relationship with California, PSECU will deposit the initial $5 minimum
Share 1 (Regular Savings Account) balance requirement for membership into each new California member
account. (A $5 minimum share purchase will be made on behalf of the member by PSECU. If the member account
is closed within the first year of membership, the initial $5 share will be retained by PSECU.)

Consumers on campus may make deposits to other financial institution accounts through a PSECU ATM. PSECU
does not surcharge for non-member deposits, but does surcharge non-member withdrawal transactions at a rate
of $1.50 at our California campus ATMs to offset the expense of the free services provided to our membership.
