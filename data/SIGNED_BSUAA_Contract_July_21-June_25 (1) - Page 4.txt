Effect of Breach. If Sponsor fails to make timely payment of the sponsorship amounts by the applicable payment
dates set forth in the Contract and Payment Terms section {and fails to cure such non-payment within ten (10)
days after receiving from BSUAA written notice thereof), then BSUAA reserves the right, but is not obligated, to
suspend delivery (or provision) to Sponsor of any further sponsorship recognitions or benefits under this
Agreement and/or to terminate this Agreement effective upon written notice from BSUAA to Sponsor. If Sponsor
breaches the Trademarks section (including, without limitation, any unauthorized use of BSUAA?s Trademarks),
then BSUAA reserves the right to terminate this Agreement effective upon written notice from BSUAA to Sponsor.
If BSUAA terminates this Agreement before the Term expires due to Sponsor?s breach in accordance with this
section, then Sponsor shall remain liable for payment of all applicable sponsorship amounts for the entire Contract
Year during which the termination occurred, less only the actual amount BSUAA can recoup for such Contract
Year?s sponsorship elements not used by Sponsor through sponsorship agreements BSUAA obtains from other
sponsors after the effective termination date and before such Contract Year?s conclusion.

Sponsor agrees that if any charges incurred are not paid by the applicable due date and if, for the purposes of
collecting the amount due, BSUAA should retain an attorney or collection agency, Sponsor will pay all costs of
collection, including reasonable interest, reasonable attorney?s fees, and reasonable collection agency fees, which
may be based on a percentage at a maximum of forty percent (40%) of the debt.

Sponsor also agrees to allow BSUAA or its agent to contact Sponsor by e-mail or telephone (including via cell
phone) in an effort to collect the debt. Sponsor also authorizes BSUAA or its agent to use automated telephone
dialing equipment, and to use artificial or pre- recorded voice messages in their efforts to contact Sponsor. Further
Sponsor understands that Sponsor may withdraw consent to call Sponsor?s cell phone number by submitting a
request in writing to BSUAA or in writing to the applicable agent contacting Sponsor on behalf of BSUAA.
