2. If during any given year(s) during the initial term of this Agreement Bank recoups all
prior Advances paid by it to UHAA in prior years, and pays UHAA Eligible Royalties
accrued by UHAA over and above the Eligible Royalties used by Bank to recoup such
prior Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?), then Bank may reduce the amount of any
subsequent Advance(s) due by the amount of any such Paid Out Eligible Royalties.

F. ROYALTY GUARANTEE.

UHAA shall be guaranteed to accrue Eligible Royalties (including without limitation the amount of the
Advances) equal to or greater than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) (the ?Guarantee
Amount?) by December 31, 2018, subject to the provisions set forth below. If on December 31, 2018,
UHAA has not accrued $250,000 in Eligible Royalties, Bank will pay UHAA an amount equal to the
Guarantee Amount minus the sum of all compensation accrued by UHAA during the initial term of this
Agreement and all unrecouped Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Royalty Guarantee and
any obligation of Bank hereunder shall be expressly contingent upon the non-occurrence of any of the
conditions set forth in Subsection E.1., above.
