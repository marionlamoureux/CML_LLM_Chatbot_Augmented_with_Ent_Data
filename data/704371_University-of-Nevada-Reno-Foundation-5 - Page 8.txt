22. Dispute Resolution. If claims, controversies or disputes between the parties or the
parties? agents, employees, officers, directors, or affiliated agents (hereafter ?Dispute?)

neutral arbitrator. Any award rendered by the arbitrator will be limited to actual damages
sustained by the party in whose favor the judgment is rendered, and no consequential, incidental,
punitive, exemplary or special damages will be awarded. The arbitrator may not award relief in
excess of or inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or order consolidation or
arbitration on a class-wide basis. The arbitrator?s award will be final, non-appealable and
binding and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party will bear its own
costs and attorneys? fees and will share equally in the fees and expenses of the arbitrator.

when the alleged Dispute arose and will be made by written notice given to the other party. No
party may act as a representative of other claimants or potential claimants in any Dispute, and
two or more individuals? Disputes may not be consolidated or otherwise determined in one
proceeding, without the prior written consent of all parties. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION CONSTITUTES A

SPECIAL, STATUTORY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR TREBLE DAMAGES (?DISCLAIMED
DAMAGES?), A JURY TRIAL, OR PARTICIPATION AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS
MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION, IF FOR ANY REASON THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE
IS DEEMED INAPPLICABLE OR INVALID, UNRF AND SPFCU BOTH WAIVE ANY
CLAIMS TO RECOVER DISCLAIMED DAMAGES AND ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE, OR
PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN, CLAIMS ON A
CLASSWIDE, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS.

survive and be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable part had not been contained in this

Agreement.

or shall be construed to confer upon or give any party other than UNRF and SPFCU, their

successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.
