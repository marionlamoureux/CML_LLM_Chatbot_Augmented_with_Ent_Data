TERM AND TERMINATION

This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in full force
and effect for the Initial Term as set forth in Schedule 1 hereto (the ?Initial Term?),
unless renewed or terminated earlier pursuant to the following provisions of this Section
z.

Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall renew for successive one (1)
year renewal perlods (each, a ?Renewal Period") on the same terms and conditions,
without further notice from one Party to the other, unless terminated by either Party by
notice served not less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or
the then current Renewal Period.

Either Party may by notice terminate the Agreement if the other Party is in default of
any material obligation under this Agreement and either:

7.3.1 the default is not capable of remedy, or

7.3.2 the default is capable of remedy and the defaulting Party shall have failed to
remedy the default within thirty (30) days of notice to the defaulting Party
specifying the default and requiring its remedy.

Bank shall have the option to terminate this Agreement upon one hundred and eighty
(180) days written notice to you without cause. After three (3) years, either party shall
have the option to terminate upon one hundred and eighty (180) notice without cause.

If either Party becomes insolvent in that its liabilities exceed its assets, it is adjudicated
insolvent, or files for or is subject to any insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization
proceeding (excluding any involuntary petition dismissed or discharged within sixty (60)
days of filing), it makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors prior to bankruptcy, it
is unable to meet or has ceased paying its obligations as they generally become due, or
it applies for or Is subject to receivership, trusteeship, conservatorship or liquidation,
then the other Party may immediately terminate this Agreement.

If there is a change in the General Requirements of Law and either Party reasonably
concludes that this Agreement cannot be performed without violating such General
Requirements of Law as so modified, or if the application of such modified General
Requirements of Law will impose material and additional costs on such Party that such
Party reasonably determines cannot be avoided by such Party, the Party affected by
the change shall have the right to provide the other Party prompt notice hereof. The
notice shall include a detailed explanation of such change and evidence of the illegality
or material, additional and reasonably unavoidable costs imposed as a result of such
change. Within thirty (30) days of such notice, the Parties will begin to negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement to the extent necessary to ensure that the Parties
will be in full compliance with all applicable General Requirements of Law. In the event
that any change in General Requirements of Law make the continued performance by
either Party under the then-current terms and conditions of the Program illegal, and the
parties are unable to agree upon modifications to this Agreement within ninety (90)
days of such notice, then either Party will have the right to terminate this Agreement
