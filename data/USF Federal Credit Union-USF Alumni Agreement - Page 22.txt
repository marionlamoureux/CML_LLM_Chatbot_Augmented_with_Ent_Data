Dear Miles:

Thank you very much for your time on September 5 and for your unwavering support of the partnership
between USF Federal Credit Union and USF Alumni Association,

As a follow up to our discussion, please find attached a letter agreement to formalize the current
operational understanding between our two entities. Although we are both operating in good faith to
the letter of this agreement, it would serve us both well to have a fully executed agreement in place.

USF Alumni Association has enjoyed the seven years of partnering with USF Federal Credit Union and
we look forward to many successful years ahead. As always, thank you for the opportunity to bring
your unique and beneficial financial products to alumni and friends of the University of South Florida.

| look forward to receiving the signed agreement and focusing on growing the business (including your
home loan business) toward even greater success,

Sincerely,

Udi

William H. McCausland
Executive Director
