Royalties as described in Schedule A to BAA with respect to accounts in good standing.

Form) or other IRS required form (e.g., W-8) is fully completed and returned to Bank. Except as

approximately 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter.

(c) if at any time during the Term any change in any card network?s interchange rate(s) or similar

more than a de minimis adverse impact on Bank?s businesses (including the businesses of any Bank

discretion (?impact?), then Bank may notify BAA in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the Royalties
and any other financial terms in the Agreement to address the Impact. If, within 30 business days after
BAA?s receipt of Bank?s notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum

without penalty or liability to BAA, upon 90 days advance written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in
the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement
as provided for in this Subsection 5(c), such terminated program remains subject to the applicable
survival provisions, if any and any other Section that by its terms are meant to survive the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations in any other provision of this
Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program shall be null and void, in each case
