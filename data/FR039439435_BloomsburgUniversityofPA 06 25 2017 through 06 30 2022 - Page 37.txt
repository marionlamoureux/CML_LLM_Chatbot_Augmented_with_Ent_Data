University students, faculty and staff would incur little or no costs related to the products and
services associated with their PSECU account. Please refer to Appendix C for PSECU?s current
fee schedule. As part of our relationship with Bloomsburg, PSECU will deposit the initial $5
minimum Share 1 (Regular Savings Account) balance requirement for membership into each

new Bloomsburg member account.

PSECU is committed to delivering world class service by offering the products and services
listed below:

Free Checking - Despite industry trends, we still believe that our members should not be
charged usage fees or be required to carry a minimum balance in their checking account. While

we charge members a fee for non-sufficient funds, please refer to Appendix C for details on our
Fee Schedule, this can be avoided if the member uses our free overdraft transfer service.

* No monthly usage fee

* No minimum balance required

* Free PSECU basic-style checks
* Free overdraft transfer service - There is no fee for this service. When Checking Shares

do not have sufficient funds to clear an item that is presented, Overdraft Transfer
Service allows money to be pulled from other available funds to clear that item. You
may select shares as overdraft options. You may also select one of two loan types,
Provided you have established the line of credit. You must have those shares or loans
on your account, and they must be under the same member's account number. You may
add or remove your overdraft options at any time. Federal regulations limit overdrafts
to six per share account per month. There is no limit, however, to the number of times
your Visa? can be accessed by overdraft, provided there is available credit.

* _ As of 09/23/2016: Annual Percentage Yield = 0.10% and Dividend Rate = 0.10%

Visa? ATM/Debit Card - Over 270,670 members carry our Visa? debit card both nationally and

internationally.
