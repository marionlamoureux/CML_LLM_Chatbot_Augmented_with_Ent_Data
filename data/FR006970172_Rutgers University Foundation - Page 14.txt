Program Payments

FNBO shall pay RUF $200,000 on the annual anniversary of each of the first six Program Years of the Initial Term. Each $200,000
payment is a ?Program Payment." The first Program Payment shall be paid at the end of the first Program Year. Each Program
Payment paid for the first six Program Years shall be paid by FNBO regardless of whether the previous Program Year's total
compensation payable to RUF exceeded the following Program Years Program Payment. The Program Payment shall be paid by
June 30 in each applicable Prograrn Year.

At the end of the seventh Program Year (the end of the Initial Term), FNBO will calculate the actual compensation earned by RUF
during all seven Program Years of the Initial Term, and will determine whether the six Program Payments made by FNBO exceed the
actual compensation eamed during the seven Program Years of the Initial Term. If the actual compensation eamed by RUF exceeds
the Program Payments paid by FNBO for the six Program Years, FNBO will pay the excess amount eamed in Program Year seven to
RUF according to the terms of the Compensation Schedule.

In the event the total compensation eamed by RUF during the seven Program Years of the Initial Term does not exceed the totat
Program Payments for the first six Program Years, the Program Payment for the seventh Program Year will be reduced by the amount
by which the total compensation eamed during the seven Program Years is less than the Program Payments for the seven Program
Years. For this Scenario 2, Program Payments for Program Year 6 will not exceed total compensation earned by RUF in Program Year
seven by more than $200,000.

In the event that the actual compensation earned by RUF during the first seven Program Years is more than $200,000 tess than the
Program Payments attributable to the first seven Program Years, the parties agree that no Program Payment will be made by to RUF
for the seventh Program Year, and that the Agreement will be automatically extended for one more Program Year (one Renewal Term).
The compensation eamed by RUF during the Renewal Term shall be offset by FNBO against the six Program Payments made to RUF.
