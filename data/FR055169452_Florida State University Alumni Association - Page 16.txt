(c) Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall, except as set forth in
Subsection 11(d), cease to use the Association Trademarks and University Trademarks for Program
marketing purposes, provided that Bank may conclude all solicitations required by Applicable Law.
Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall not claim any right, title, or
interest in or to the Association Trademarks, University Trademarks or to the Marketing Lists. The
provisions of this Subsection 11(c) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(d) Bank shall have the right to prior review and approval of any notice in connection with, relating
or referring to the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement to be communicated by or on
behalf of Association or any Association Affiliate to the Members. Upon expiration or earlier
termination of this Agreement, Bank shall have until the later of (i) 120 days from the termination or

Bank?s sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify Association in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate
the terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If, within 30 business days after Association?s receipt

satisfactory to both Parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the
Credit Card Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to Association, upon
90 days advance written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or
Credit Card Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 11(e),

meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
