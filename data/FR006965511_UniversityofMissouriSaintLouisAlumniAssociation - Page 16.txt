The Visa net interchange rate is an internal rate calculated by Commerce for each rewards card
program based upon Visa interchange income for each rewards card program as related to all
accountholder total purchase volume for each rewards card program, with such rate generally re-
calculated each January 1 and July 1. Merchandise returns, credits and amounts in dispute are
deducted from Accountholder total purchase volume to reach ?Net Merchandise Purchases.?

and quasi-cash transactions, such as, but not limited to, traveler?s checks, convenience checks,
wire transfers, money orders, balance transfers and gaming chips or fees or premiums for

Agreement, a ?Statused? account is one that is lost, stolen, credit-revoked, closed, bankrupt,
charged-off, over-limit and/or delinquent.

Commerce shall pay Association a fee for each new Association Account opened and Active (an
?Active? account is one that is newly opened and activated, that is, a Association Account on
which a Member initiated debit transaction, i.e., a purchase, balance transfer, cash advance or
convenience check occurs within ninety (90) days of account opening), compensation (?New
Account Fee?) of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) for each Active Association Account.
