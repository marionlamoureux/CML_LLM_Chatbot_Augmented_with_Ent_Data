carriers. USCAA shail not attempt to cause the removal of USCAA Trademarks and University
Trademarks from any Person?s credit devices, debit devices, checks or records of any Customer existing
as of 90 days immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of the Term. Bank shall have
the right to use USCAA Trademarks and University Trademarks on such credit devices, debit devices,
checks and records until their normally scheduled reissue date or exhaustion. The provisions of this
Subsection 11(d) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

{e) if Applicable Law has or could have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses (including the
businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined in
Bank?s sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify USCAA in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the
terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If, within 30 business days after USCAA?s receipt of Bank?s
notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory to
both Parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card
Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to USCAA, upon 90 days advance
written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card
Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 11(e), such
terminated program remains subject to the Sections in the Agreement that by its express terms are
meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program shall
be null and void, in each case as if the termination of such program was a termination or expiration of
the Agreement for just that program.

(f) For the 1 year period immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement for any reason, USCAA agrees that neither USCAA nor any USCAA Affiliate shall, by itself or in
conjunction with others, directly or indirectly, target any offer of a Financial Service Product or a related
product to persons who were Customers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, USCAA may, after the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, offer persons who were Customers the opportunity
to participate in another financial service program endorsed by USCAA, provided the Opportunity is not
only made available to such persons but rather as a part of a general solicitation to all Members and
provided further that persons are not directly or indirectly identified as a customer of Bank, or offered
any terms or incentives that differ from those offered to all Members. The provisions of this Subsection
11(f) shail survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(g) If ordered or requested to do so by any Governmental Authority, Bank may terminate this
Agreement without further obligation or penalty upon reasonable prior notice to USCAA effective as of
the date specified in such notice or as required by such Governmental Authority.

(h) In addition to the requirements of Section 11(d), and subject to Section 11(f), USCAA may, at its
sole discretion, communicate to Members through its own communications channels regarding the
termination or expiration of the Program. Any such communication in connection with, relating to or
referring to the termination of the Agreement must adhere to the following conditions:

(i) There shalt be no mention of USCAA?s new credit card issuer, nor any link or phone
number of such new credit card issuer;

(ii) The communication shall be factually accurate and shall not disparage Bank, its Affiliates
or employees or any Bank or Bank Affiliate product or service;

{iii} Bank shall have final approval over the content of such notice and timing of such notice;
and
