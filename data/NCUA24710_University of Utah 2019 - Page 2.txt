if offered, whether they are acceptable to Sponsor (?Alternative Benefits?). If Alternative Benefits are offered and
accepted, then this Agreement shall not terminate as a result of the University Notice but instead shall remain in full force
and effect under the same terms and conditions set forth herein except that the Benefits shall be replaced with the
Alternative Benefits. Upon Provider and Sponsor agreeing upon the Alternative Benefits, Exhibit A to this Agreement
shall be replaced with a new Exhibit A to reflect the Alternative Benefits. If there are any other modifications to this
Agreement as a result of the Alternative Benefits being substituted for the Benefits, the Parties will execute an amendment
to this Agreement setting forth each such modification. If for any reason other than a Force Majeure condition described
in Paragraph 5 of this Agreement or a University Notice, Provider is unable, for any other reason, other than due to
Sponsor's fault, to provide Sponsor with a Benefit described in Exhibit A, Provider shall give written notice to Sponsor
and offer Sponsor mutually agreeable make-good benefits in direct and fair proportion to the benefits which Provider
cannot provide to Sponsor (?Alternative Make-Good Benefits"). The Alternative Make-Good Benefits may not,
however, include tickets, hospitality, catering or similar benefits which involve an out-of-pocket cost to Provider. The
Alternative Make-Good Benefits shall be subject to Sponsor?s approval, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Until such time as the Alternative Make-Good Benefits are agreed upon, Sponsor will
continue to pay the full sponsorship fee to Provider as set forth above. If Alternative Make-Good Benefits are not agreed
upon, this Agreement shall not terminate, but rather the sponsorship fee to be paid by Sponsor will be adjusted to reflect
the benefits which are not available to Sponsor.

Payment Obligations of Sponsor. In consideration of the Benefits to be provided to Sponsor by Provider, Sponsor will
pay Provider the amounts set forth below at the times set forth below:
