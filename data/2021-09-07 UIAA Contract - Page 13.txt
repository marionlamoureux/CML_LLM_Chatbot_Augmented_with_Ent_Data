Credit Union will have the right to prior review and approval of any notice in
connection with, relating or referring to the expiration or earlier termination of
this Agreement to be communicated by Alumni Association or any Alumni
Association Affiliate to the Members; provided, however, that Credit Union's
review and approval shall be limited to a determination that the content is
factually accurate, complies with any obligation of confidentiality between the
parties, and does not criticize, disparage, condemn or impugn the reputation or
character of Credit Union provided such review and approval shall not be required
for a termination following a breach by Credit Union. Such approval will not be
unreasonably withheld. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement,
Credit Union will have up to six (6) calendar months from the termination or
expiration date to: (i) suspend marketing and remove marketing materials from
Credit Union's marketing channels; (ii) shall have up to twelve(12) months to
remove Trademarks from Program collateral and account materials, such as
statements, welcome packages, reissued or replaced credit devices, and card
carriers. Alumni Association shall not attempt to cause the removal of
Trademarks from any person's credit devices or records of any Customer existing
as of termination date or expiration date of this Agreement, and Credit Union
shall have the right to use Trademarks on such credit devices, and records until
their normally scheduled reissue date or replacement or exhaustion.

If Applicable Law has or will have a material adverse effect on Credit Union's
businesses (including the businesses of any Credit Union Affiliate providing a
product or service under this Agreement), as determined in Credit Union's sole
discretion ("Event"), Credit Union may notify Alumni Association in writing of
Credit Union's desire to renegotiate the terms of the Agreement to address the
Event. If, within thirty (30) business days after Alumni Association's receipt of
Credit Union's notice, the parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an
addendum that is satisfactory to both parties, Credit Union shall have the right to
terminate either the Credit Card Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without
penalty or liability to Alumni Association, upon ninety (90) days advance written
notice. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Credit Card Program is terminated
earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Section 11(e), such terminated
program remains subject to the provisions described in the sections referenced in
Section 11(d) of the Agreement and any other section in the Agreement that by its
terms are meant to survive the termination of this Agreement, and the rights and
obligations in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products
offered under such program shall be null and void, in each case, as if the
termination of such program was a termination or expiration of the Agreement for
just that program.

For a one (1) year period immediately following the termination of this
Agreement, Alumni Association agrees that neither Alumni Association, nor any
Alumni Association Affiliate will, by itself or in conjunction with others, directly
or indirectly, target any offer of Credit Card Services to persons who were
Customers provided the foregoing shall not apply to termination resulting from a
material breach by Credit Union. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Alumni
