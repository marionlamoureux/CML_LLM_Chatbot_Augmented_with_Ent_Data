(c) Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall, except as set forth in
Subsection 11(d), cease to use the NYUAA Trademarks for Program marketing purposes, provided that
Bank may conclude all solicitations required by Applicable Law. Upon the expiration or earlier
termination of this Agreement, Bank shall not claim any right, title, or interest in or to the NYUAA
Trademarks or to the Marketing Lists. The provisions of this Subsection 11(c) shall survive the expiration
or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(d) Bank shall have the right to prior review and approval of any notice in connection with, relating
or referring to the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement to be communicated by or on
behalf of NYU or any NYU Affiliate to the Members. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement, Bank shall have until the later of (i) 120 days from the termination or expiration date (ii) or
as soon as operationally reasonable by the Bank to: (x) suspend marketing and remove marketing
materials from Bank?s marketing channels; (y) use NYUAA Trademarks in connection with existing
Deposit Accounts, Credit Card Accounts and those opened during such period; and, (z) remove NYUAA
Trademarks from Program collateral and account materials in Bank?s possession, such as statements,
welcome packages, and card carriers. NYU shall not attempt to cause the removal of NYUAA
Trademarks from any Person?s credit devices, debit devices, checks or records of any Customer existing
as of the day 90 days immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of the Term. Bank shall
have the right to use NYUAA Trademarks on such credit devices, debit devices, checks and records until
their normally scheduled reissue date or exhaustion and issue credit cards bearing NYUAA Trademarks
until such date. The provisions of this Subsection 11(d) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination
of this Agreement.

(e) If Applicable Law has or could have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses (including the
businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined in
Bank?s sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify NYU in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the
terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If, within 30 business days after NYU?s receipt of Bank?s
notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory to
both Parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card
Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to NYU, upon 90 days advance
written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card
Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 11(e), such
terminated program remains subject to the Sections in the Agreement that by its express terms are
meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program shall
be null and void, in each case as if the termination of such program was a termination or expiration of
the Agreement for just that program.

(f) If at any time during the Term any change in any card network?s interchange rate(s) or similar
rate(s), when measured separately or together with all other rate changes since the Effective Date, has
more than a de minimis adverse impact on Bank?s businesses (including the businesses of any Bank
Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined by Bank in its sole
discretion (?Impact?), then Bank may notify NYU in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the Royalties
and any other financial terms in the Agreement to address the Impact. If, within 30 business days after
NYU?s receipt of Bank?s notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum
that modifies the Royalties and other financial terms to address the Impact, Bank shall have the right to
terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card Program, or the Agreement in its entirety,
without penalty or liability to NYU and University, upon 90 days advance written notice. For the
