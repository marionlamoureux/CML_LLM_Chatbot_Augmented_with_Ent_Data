Advances to USCAA hereunder, and (y) USCAA hereby promises to pay Bank upon demand an amount
equal to the difference between the total amount of the Advance(s) paid by Bank and the total amount
of accrued Eligible Royalties credited by Bank against such Advance(s) as of the date of such demand, in
the event any of the conditions set forth in Clauses (i) through (iv) below should occur:

(i) the Agreement is terminated prior to the end of the Term as stated in this Agreement as of the
Effective Date;

(ii) USCAA breaches any of its material obligations under this Agreement and such material breach is
Not cured within the Cure Period or within such additional time to cure as may be agreed to by the
Parties;

(iii) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented by USCAA from conducting at least six (6) direct mail
campaigns to the full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during
the Term; and

(iv) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented by USCAA from conducting at least two (2) e-mail
campaigns to the full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during
the Term.

2 If during any given year(s) during the Initial Term of this Agreement Bank recoups all prior Advances paid
by it to USCAA in prior years, and pays USCAA Eligible Royalties accrued by USCAA over and above the
Eligible Royalties used by Bank to recoup such prior Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?), then Bank may
reduce the amount of any subsequent Advance(s) due by the amount of any such Paid Out Royalties.

ROYALTY GUARANTEE

USCAA shall be guaranteed to accrue Eligible Royalties (including the amount of the Advances) equal to
or greater than one million seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,750,000.00) (the ?Guarantee
Amount?) by July 31, 2023, subject to the provisions set forth below; however, the foregoing shall in no
way restrict USCAA?s ability to seek damages against Bank in the event USCAA terminates the
Agreement prior to July 31, 2023 pursuant to Sections 11(a) or (b). If on July 31, 2023, USCAA has not
accrued $1,750,000.00 in Eligible Royalties, Bank will pay USCAA an amount equal to the Guarantee
Amount minus the sum of all compensation accrued by USCAA during the Term and all unrecouped
Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Royalty Guarantee and any obligation of Bank hereunder
shall be expressly contingent upon the non-occurrence of any of the conditions set forth in Subsection
E.1., above.
