Cost to the Consumer

PSECU believes a member should not pay to use their account, and has adopted a low- or no-fee
philosophy. University students, faculty and staff will incur few or no costs related to the products and
services associated with their PSECU account. As part of our relationship with Millersville, PSECU will
deposit the initial $5 minimum Share 1 (Regular Savings Account) balance requirement for membership
into each new Millersville member account. (A $5 minimum share purchase will be made on behalf of
the member by PSECU. If the member account is closed within the first year of membership, the initial
$5 share will be retained by PSECU.)

Consumers on campus may make deposits to other financial institution accounts through a PSECU ATM.
PSECU does not surcharge for non-member deposits, but does surcharge non-member withdrawal
transactions at a rate of $1.50 at our Millersville campus ATMs to offset the expense of the free services
provided to our membership.
