of accrued Royalties credited by Bank against such Advance(s) as of the date of such demand, in the event any of
the conditions set forth in Clauses (i) through (iii) below should occur:

(i) the Agreement is terminated prior to the end of the Initial Term as stated in this Agreement as of
the Effective Date;

(ii) NU breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement; and

(iii) Bank is prohibited or otherwise prevented from conducting at least six (6) direct mail campaigns to
the full updated Marketing List during each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Term.

2. If during any given year(s) during the Initial Term, Bank recoups all prior Advances paid by it to NU in prior
years, and pays NU Royalties accrued by NU over and above the Royalties used by Bank to recoup such prior
Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?), then Bank may reduce the amount of any subsequent Advance(s) due by
the amount of any such Paid Out Royalties.

F. ROYALTY GUARANTEE

Excluding Royalties for GIP Accounts, NU shall be guaranteed to accrue Royalties (including the amount of the
Advances) equal to or greater than one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000) (the ?Guarantee Amount?) by
June 30, 2023, subject to the provisions set forth below. If on June 30, 2023, NU has not accrued $160,000 in
Royalties, Bank will pay NU an amount equal to the Guarantee Amount minus the sum of all compensation
accrued by NU up to and including June 30, 2023 and all unrecouped Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Royalty Guarantee and any obligation of Bank hereunder shall be expressly contingent upon the non-
occurrence of any of the conditions set forth in Subsection E.1., above.
