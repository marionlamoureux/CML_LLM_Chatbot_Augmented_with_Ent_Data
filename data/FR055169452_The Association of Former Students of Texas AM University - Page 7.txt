Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement to the contrary, Association acknowled ges
and agrees that Bank may market any financial service products or services that Bank or any Bank
Affiliate offers (e.g., credit cards and deposit products, collectively "Bank Products")
contemporaneously with the promotion of Deposits and that such Bank Products are not subject to
this Agreement. However, Bank agrees that it shall not, when using Association?s Marketing
Lists for Deposits, market Bank Products (excluding ?Deposits Offers?, as defined below), in
direct mail copy, in an e-mail or an outbound telemarketing solicitation, unless Association
consents to Bank?s use of the Marketing Lists for such purposes. ?Deposits Offers? means any

have a connection with Deposits (e.g, Online Banking and $0 Trade). Bank may maintain
separately all information it obtains as a result of an account application for, and/or an account
relationship in connection with, Deposits or a Bank Product. All such information becomes a part
of Bank?s own files and shall not be subject to the Agreement.
