the Term. Each Party?s agreement to Bank?s participation at such event(s) shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

2. If during any given year(s) during the Initial Term, Bank recoups all prior Advances paid by it to AU in prior
years, and pays AU Royalties accrued by AU over and above the Royalties used by Bank to recoup such prior
Advances (the ?Paid Out Royalties?), then Bank may reduce the amount of any subsequent Advance(s) due by
the amount of any such Paid Out Royalties.

E. ROYALTY GUARANTEE

AU shall be guaranteed to accrue Eligible Royalties (including the amount of the Advances) equal to or greater
than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) (the ?Guarantee Amount?) by September 30, 2022, subject to
the provisions set forth below. If on September 30, 2022, AU has not accrued $300,000 in Eligible Royalties,
Bank will pay AU an amount equal to the Guarantee Amount minus the sum of all compensation accrued by AU
up to and including September 30, 2022 and all unrecouped Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Royalty Guarantee and any obligation of Bank hereunder shall be expressly contingent upon the non-occurrence
of any of the conditions set forth in Subsection D.1., above.
