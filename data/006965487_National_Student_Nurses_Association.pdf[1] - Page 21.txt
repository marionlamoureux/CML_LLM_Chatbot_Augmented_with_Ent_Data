CARD CUSTOMIZATION SERVICES

SERVICE DESCRIPTION
Background

1.1.1. The Card Customization Services will be a hosted (ASP) solution to enable Cardholders
using a design interface to customize the appearance of their Card using Customer-selected
images on the face of the Card.

1.1.2 You shall agree with Bank on a set-up for Card Customization that identifies the number and
type of permissible customization options that may be selected by a Customer and which
will be incorporated into Bank's Card Designer. Following such agreement, Bank shall
incorporate the selected customization options into the Card Designer and shall make the
Card Designer available to the general public over the internet, and shall host and support it
during the Term.

1.1.3. Bank shall have no responsibility for ensuring that the equipment of any Cardholder seeking
to access or use the Card Designer complies with the applicable technical requirements to
operate the Card Customization program.

Design Interface
1.2.1 The Card Designer will:

1.2.1.1. make available up to five categories of up to nine images each, which may be
used for Card production if the Cardholder does not opt to upload his or her own
image;

1.2.1.2 allow the Cardholder to upload their own image(s);

1.2.1.3 allow the Cardholder to manipulate the image, (which may be either a stock gallery
or Cardholder uploaded image), using standard controls; and

1.2.1.4 generate a unique identifier assigned to each submitted card design, and include It
as a parameter into a return URL agreed between the Parties,

1.2.2 For the avoidance of doubt, you shall not be entitled to request any changes to the Card
Designer after the set-up parameters have been agreed between you and Bank.

image Checking

1.3.1 Bank verifies that each image submitted by a Cardholder for incorporation into a Card for
compliance with the provisions of Section 4.7 of the Agreement, and retains the right to
reject any image that does not, in the Bank?s view, meet the qualifications set forth in that
section of the Agreement. Bank?s determination in that regard is final.

1.3.2 YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IMAGE CHECKING IS
PROVIDED BY BANK SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BANK
AND THE CARD ASSOCIATION. AS A RESULT, WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SECTION 8
OF THE AGREEMENT, BANK SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO A
CARDHOLDER FOR ANY LOSS SUFFERED BY YOU OR BY A CARDHOLDER IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY ACT OR OMISSION ARISING OUT OF ITS PERFORMANCE
(OR THAT OF ITS SUBCONTRACTORS) OF IMAGE CHECKING IN RELATION TO USER
PROVIDED IMAGES.
