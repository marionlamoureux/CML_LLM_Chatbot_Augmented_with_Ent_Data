and Agents to introduce) such fix or patch as soon as commercially reasonable after ESAUT (or its
subcontractors and its and their respective Representatives and Agents) becomes aware of the security

subcontractors and its and their respective Representatives and Agents), including application software,

to another person or entity in violation of this Agreement, or uses such Information for a purpose not
expressly permitted by this Agreement, such act shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by
that Party. The non-breaching Party may, in addition to any other right or remedy available at law or in
equity and upon ten (10) days prior written notice to the other Party, cease providing the other Party with
any reports (other than the royalty report described in this Agreement) or other information (other than
the Marketing List) concerning the Program or the Agreement, whether or not a requirement of the
Agreement.

(g) If a breach of this Section 7 is due to the unauthorized disclosure of the Marketing List by Bank or
its Representative (or the use of the Marketing List by Bank or its Representative in a manner not
permitted by this Agreement), except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, Bank and its Agent shall
immediately cease and desist from all further uses of the Marketing List and must completely refrain from
using the Marketing List until (and if) the breach is cured.

(h) The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement.
