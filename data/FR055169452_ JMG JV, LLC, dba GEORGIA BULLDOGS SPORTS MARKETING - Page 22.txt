(r) Each Party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this
Agreement or any related agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore
each such Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to a trial
by jury with respect to any litigation between or among the Parties directly or indirectly arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any related agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this
agreement or any related agreement. Each Party hereto certifies and acknowledges that: (a) no
representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
other Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver; (b) such Party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver; (c) such Party makes this waiver
voluntarily; and (d) such Party has been induced to enter into this Agreement and each related
agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Subsection 12(r). The
provisions of this Subsection 12(r) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(s) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, no right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to any Party (including any termination pursuant to Section 11) is intended to be
exclusive of any other right or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in

addition to any other right or remedy under this Agreement, or under law or regulation, whether now or
hereafter existing.

OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER PARTIES OR
ANY THIRD-PARTY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF
USE OF DATA, OR LOST REVENUE OR PROFIT, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF BREACH OF
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE AND WHETHER OR NOT THE BREACHING PARTY WAS
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

(2) THE LIABILITY LIMITATION SET FORTH IN (1) ABOVE SHALL NOT APPLY TO DAMAGES OR
LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION
HEREUNDER NOR TO DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM A MATERIAL BREACH OF THE
