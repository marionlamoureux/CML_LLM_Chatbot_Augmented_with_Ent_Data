(v) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is subject to receivership, conservatorship or
liquidation; or
(vi) becomes insolvent in that its liabilities exceed its assets,

then the other Party may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice
given by such Party as provided herein.

(c) Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall, except as set forth in
Subsection 11(d), cease to use the CAA Trademarks and University Trademarks for Program marketing
purposes, provided that Bank may conclude all solicitations required by Applicable Law. Upon the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Bank shall not claim any right, title, or interest in or
to the CAA Trademarks, University Trademarks or to the Marketing Lists. The provisions of this
Subsection 11(c) shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(d) Bank shall have the right to prior review and approval of any notice in connection with, relating
or referring to the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement to be communicated by or on
behalf of CAA or any CAA Affiliate to the Members. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement, Bank shall have until the later of (i) 120 days from the termination or expiration date or (ii)
as soon as operationally reasonable by the Bank to: (x) suspend marketing and remove marketing
materials from Bank?s marketing channels; (y) use CAA Trademarks and University Trademarks in
connection with existing Deposit Accounts and Credit Card Accounts those opened during such period;
and, (z) remove CAA Trademarks and University Trademarks from Program collateral and account
materials in Bank?s possession, such as statements, welcome packages, and card carriers. CAA shall not
attempt to cause the removal of CAA Trademarks and University Trademarks from any Person?s credit
devices, debit devices, checks or records of any Customer existing as of the latter of 90 days
immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of the Term. Bank shall have the right to use
CAA Trademarks and University Trademarks on such credit devices, debit devices, checks and records
until their normally scheduled reissue date or exhaustion and issue credit cards bearing CAA Trademarks
and University Trademarks until such date. The provisions of this Subsection 11(d) shall survive the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

(e) If Applicable Law has or could have a material adverse effect on Bank?s businesses (including the
businesses of any Bank Affiliate providing a product or service under this Agreement), as determined in
Bank?s sole discretion (?Event?), Bank may notify CAA in writing of Bank?s desire to renegotiate the
terms of the Agreement to address the Event. If, within 30 business days after CAA?s receipt of Bank?s
notice, the Parties have not, for whatever reason, fully executed an addendum that is satisfactory to
both Parties, Bank shall have the right to terminate either the Deposits Program or the Credit Card
Program, or the Agreement in its entirety, without penalty or liability to CAA, upon 90 days advance
written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Deposit Program or Credit Card
Program is terminated earlier than the Agreement as provided for in this Subsection 11(e), such
terminated program remains subject to the Sections in the Agreement that by its express terms are
meant to survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
in any other provision of this Agreement with respect to the products offered under such program shall
be null and void, in each case as if the termination of such program was a termination or expiration of
the Agreement for just that program.

(f) For the 1 year period immediately following the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement for any reason, CAA agrees that neither CAA nor any CAA Affiliate shall, by itself or in
conjunction with others, directly or indirectly, target any offer of a Financial Service Product or a related
